#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Preservation or restoration of forests under REDD+ and investment in international soil protection    

dns_indicator_definition: Indicator 15.3.a shows the results-based payments by Germany to developing and emerging countries for the verified preservation or restoration of forests under the REDD+ rulebook. Indicator 15.3.b covers Germany’s gross bilateral development expenditure in connection with the implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in developing and emerging countries.    

dns_indicator_intention: Preventing deforestation and forest degradation (damage), managing forests sustainably, restoring forests and creating new woodland all directly and indirectly help to maintain biodiversity, improve soil, water and air quality, reduce soil erosion, cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, sequester carbon, and safeguard important prospects of development and income-generation for forest-rich countries. The aim is to keep increasing payments under the REDD+ rulebook until 2030. Healthy soils are an essential natural resource that is extremely difficult if not impossible to renew. They play a pivotal role in food production, the mitigation of the effects of frequent and extreme weather events, the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of essential ecosystem services. The goal is therefore to continuously increase Germany’s contribution to international soil protection until 2030. At the international level, combating desertification is one of the topics of the three Rio Conventions, alongside biodiversity and climate change.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Taken from the official translation of the German Sustainable Development Strategy</i><br><br>Indicator 15.3.a is based on the rulebook for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or REDD+. REDD+ is an international concept which financially rewards governments and local communities in developing countries for reducing deforestation and thereby demonstrably cutting emissions. Contributions are paid in line with the scale of the emissions reduction measured or the amount of additional carbon sequestered. The data sources for the indicator are the financial reports compiled by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. The data have been collected annually since 2008. Duplicate counting is avoided by means of the mandatory establishment of a register.<br><br>The overall trend is positive. During the 2009-2019 reporting period, payments rose from EUR 3.0 million to EUR 63.5 million. The years 2011 and 2015 both saw a fall in payments. Of the funds paid out in 2019, EUR 50 million (78.7%) went to the multilateral Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and EUR 13.5 million (21.3%) to the bilateral REDD Early Movers Programme. No payments were made to the Amazon Fund for Forest Conservation and Climate in 2018 and 2019.<br><br>The indicator depicts part of Germany’s official development expenditure on the preservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests. Germany also supports the FCPF Readiness Fund and other programmes. Altogether, total spending for international forest conservation for 2019 amounted to EUR 660.4 million.<br><br>The data source for indicator 15.3.b is the statistics on German official development assistance which are compiled by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Relevant projects are any which Target to combat desertification or to mitigate the effects of droughts by preventing or reducing soil degradation, restoring degraded land or recultivating desert regions. However, the amounts paid give no indication as to the actual development of soil quality.<br><br>Gross development expenditure to combat desertification worldwide rose strongly in the reporting period starting in 2009. The indicator has developed positively with regard to the target set. Gross expenditure was most recently recorded at EUR 745.6 million for 2019, an 18-fold increase on the equivalent figure for 2009. A similar trend is discernible in the funds committed, which were most recently recorded at EUR 896.2 million.<br><br>Development spending under the REDD+ rulebook and in the context of the UNCCD is part of climate finance (indicator 13.1.b) and of official development assistance (indicator 17.1).
