national_indicator_available: Total nitrogen concentration in the North and the Baltic Sea                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators show the moving discharge-weighted five-year average of nitrogen concentrations in milligrams (mg) of nitrogen per litre (l) of water discharged from rivers into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.                   

dns_indicator_intention: High concentrations of nitrogen in the seas can lead to eutrophication effects such as oxygen depletion, the loss of biodiversity and to the destruction of fish spawning grounds. Therefore, the input of nitrogen should stay below 2.8&nbsp;mg nitrogen per litre discharge for the rivers flowing into the North Sea and below 2.6&nbsp;mg N/l for the rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea. This corresponds to the management targets of the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters amended in 2016 that were agreed during the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and to the objectives of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Baltic Sea Action Plan.

#Content                    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The indicators are calculated on the basis of measurements of nitrogen concentrations and water discharge levels from smaller and larger inflows into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, which the German Environment Agency compiles using information provided by the Länder and the river basin communities. This also includes smaller rivers that flow into a larger river, rather than directly into the North Sea or the Baltic Sea. The measuring points are selected in such a way as to ensure that the data of the last measuring point before the confluence of the two rivers are taken into account. The Rhine, which does not flow into the sea in Germany, is also taken into account. Here the values are measured at the point where the Rhine leaves Germany (measuring point at Kleve, district Bimmen). The nitrogen concentrations of the individual rivers are averaged on a discharge-weighted basis, so that large rivers with large volumes of water discharge have a greater influence on the average than small rivers. Another substance that is discharged via rivers into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and causes eutrophication is phosphorus. This is examined in detail in indicator 6.1.a “Phosphorus in flowing waters”.<br><br>To ensure that individual extreme events such as floods or droughts, which partly lead to very high or very low nitrogen inputs, do not distort the representativeness of the development, the values are calculated as a five-year moving average.<br><br>The discharge-weighted nitrogen concentration across all North Sea and Baltic Sea inflows showed a decreasing trend since the beginning of the time series, with the decrease in concentrations being more marked in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea. On average in 2012 to2016, North Sea and Baltic Sea inflows reached concentrations of 2.9 and 3.0&nbsp;mg/l, respectively. However, to achieve a good status in accordance with the Surface Water Ordinance, it would be necessary for each individual river to meet the management target<br><br>Of the large Baltic Sea inflows, Peene, Trave and Warnow, only the Warnow (near Rostock) met the management target in the period 2012 to 2016. The value of the Peene (near Anklam) with 2.9&nbsp;mg/l and the value of the Trave (near Lübeck-Moisling) with 3.7&nbsp;mg/l were still higher. All three rivers showed a clear decrease in the five-year average concentrations. This decline was most marked for the Trave. Regarding the small Baltic Sea inflows, nitrogen concentrations are in part still considerably higher than the management target value (up to 6.0&nbsp;mg/l).<br><br>Of the North Sea inflows, only the Rhine met the management target in the period 2012 to 2016. Regarding the other major rivers, Elbe, Ems, Weser and Eider, the Ems (near Herbrum) had the highest concentration of 4.7&nbsp;mg/l and the Elbe (near Seemannshöft) and the Eider (near Friedrichstadt) the lowest concentrations (3.1&nbsp;mg/l each). The five-year averages of concentrations decreased for all major North Sea inflows. The river Elbe showed the largest reduction. The highest nitrogen concentration of the small North Sea inflows was 3.6&nbsp;mg/l in the years 2012 to 2016. Overall, permanent and nationwide compliance with the management targets is currently neither being met for the Baltic Sea nor for the North Sea.
