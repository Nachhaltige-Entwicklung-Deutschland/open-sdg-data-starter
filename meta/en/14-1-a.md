dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators represent the five-year moving average of discharge-weighted nitrogen concentrations in milligrams (<abbr title="Miligrams" tabindex="0">mg</abbr>) of nitrogen per litre (<abbr title="Litre" tabindex="0">l</abbr>) of water discharged from rivers into the North Sea (14.1.ab) and Baltic Sea (14.1.aa)<sup>1</sup><br><br><small><sup>1</sup>For the North Sea, these are the rivers Eider, Elbe, Ems, Weser, Rhein, Treene, Aarlau, Bongsieler Kanal and Miele. For the Baltic Sea, these are the Peene, Trave, Warnow, Langballigau, Füsinger Au, Koseler Au, Schwentine, Kossau, Goddesdorfer Au, Oldenburger Graben, Aalbeck, Schwartau, Lippingau, Hagener Au, Barthe, Duvenbaek, Hellbach, Maurine, Recknitz, Ryck, Stepenitz, Uecker, Wallensteingraben and Zarow.</small>        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: High concentrations of nitrogen in the oceans can lead to eutrophication effects such as oxygen deficiency and thus to a loss of biodiversity and the destruction of fish migration areas. The management objectives of the Surface Waters Ordinance (<abbr title="Oberflächengewässerverordnung" tabindex="0">OGewV</abbr> 2016) agreed as part of the implementation of the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EC) and the objectives of the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD 2008/56/EC) and the Baltic Sea Action Plan should apply to the input of nitrogen into the Baltic Sea and North Sea via tributaries.        

political_target: '14.1.aa: Adherence to good quality in accordance with the Ordinance for the Protection of Surface Waters (annual averages for total nitrogen in rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea may not exceed 2.6&nbsp;milligrams per litre)<br>14.1.ab: Adherence to good quality in accordance with the Ordinance for the Protection of Surface Waters (annual averages for total nitrogen in rivers flowing into the North Sea may not exceed 2.8 milligrams per litre)'

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #0a97d9; font-size: large">14.1.a Nitrogen input in coastal and marine waters&nbsp;–&nbsp;Nitrogen input via the inflows into the Baltic and North Seas</b><br><br>The indicators are based on measurement data on nitrogen concentrations and water discharge volumes from both small and large inflows of the North<sup>1</sup> and Baltic Seas<sup>2</sup>. The data are compiled by the German Environment Agency (<abbr title="Federal Environment Agency" tabindex="0">UBA</abbr>), incorporating information provided by the federal states and river basin communities.<br><br>Smaller rivers that do not flow directly into the North or Baltic Sea, but first discharge into larger rivers, are also taken into account. Measurement points are selected so that the final monitoring station before the confluence is included in the evaluation in order to avoid double counting. Additionally, the Rhine is considered, even though it does not discharge into the sea within Germany. The relevant values are taken at the monitoring station in Bimmen, a district of Kleve, where the Rhine leaves German territory.<br><br>Nitrogen concentrations in individual rivers are averaged using flow-weighted means, so that rivers with high discharge volumes have a greater influence on the overall average than those with lower discharge. To prevent individual extreme events such as floods or droughts — which can result in particularly high or low nitrogen inputs — from distorting long-term trends, the results are presented as a rolling five-year average.<br><br>A major cause of nitrogen input into the North and Baltic Seas via inflows is nitrogen surplus in agriculture, as recorded in indicator 2.1.a. In addition to nitrogen, phosphorus also contributes to eutrophication. Phosphorus loads in rivers are covered separately in indicator 6.1.a.<br><br>Since the beginning of the time series, the flow-weighted nitrogen concentration of all inflows to the North and Baltic Seas has shown a declining trend. This decrease is more pronounced for the North Sea tributaries than for those discharging into the Baltic Sea. The average concentration of nitrogen in the North Sea inflows between 2019&nbsp;and 2023&nbsp;was 2.7&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>, and thus for the fourth time in a row below the politically defined target value of 2.8&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>. In contrast, the Baltic Sea inflows recorded an average concentration of 3.0&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> over the same period — significantly exceeding the upper limit of 2.6&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>In contrast to the aggregated indicator 14.1.a “Nitrogen input via tributaries into the North and Baltic Seas”, achieving good ecological status under the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (<abbr title="Oberflächengewässerverordnung" tabindex="0">OGewV</abbr>) requires each individual river to meet its respective management target. This goal is currently not met for either the North or Baltic Sea tributaries.<br><br>Among the major Baltic Sea inflows, only the Warnow achieved the management target of 2.6&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> with an average of 2.15&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> over the 2019–2023&nbsp;period. The Peene (2.80&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) and Trave (3.56&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) each exceeded the target value. Smaller Baltic Sea inflows showed, on average, significantly higher nitrogen concentrations in the same period — with values reaching up to 6.2&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> (Duvenbaek), in some cases several times above the target value. Overall, only about one fifth of these smaller rivers meet the target.<br><br>Among the North Sea inflows, only the Rhine (2.5&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) and the Bongsieler Kanal (2.6&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) achieved the management target of 2.8&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> between 2019&nbsp;and 2023, making a key contribution to keeping the flow-weighted average below the politically defined threshold. Among the major North Sea inflows, the Weser (3.5&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) and Ems (4.0&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr>) recorded the highest nitrogen concentrations. The smaller North Sea inflows had five-year averages ranging from 2.6&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> (Bongsieler Kanal) to 3.5&nbsp;<abbr title="Miligrams per litre" tabindex="0">mg/l</abbr> (Aarlau).<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> Eider, Elbe, Ems, Weser, Rhine, Treene, Aarlau, Bongsieler Kanal, and Miele.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Peene, Trave, Warnow, Langballigau, Füsinger Au, Koseler Au, Schwentine, Kossau, Goddesdorfer Au, Oldenburger Graben, Aalbeck, Schwartau, Lippingau, Hagener Au, Barthe, Duvenbaek, Hellbach, Maurine, Recknitz, Ryck, Stepenitz, Uecker, Wallensteingraben, and Zarow.<br><br></smal></p>'
