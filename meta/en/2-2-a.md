#Metadata                   
national_indicator_available: Disbursements mainly to developing and newly industrialising countries to support good governance for food security                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator measures the percentage share of disbursed funds in total expenditure on food security that is used for the implementation of relevant international norms and recommendations for the realisation of the right to food (defined by the Global Strategic Framework of the United Nations Committee on World Food Security).                   

dns_indicator_intention: The indicator is based on the assumption that supporting the implementation of international guidelines and recommendations for food security will improve nutrition. Thus, a substantial contribution towards fulfilling SDG 2 and towards the realisation of the right to food can be achieved. The share of disbursements used for good governance for food security should be increased adequately by 2030.                   

indicator_name: Support for good governance in attaining appropriate nutrition globally                   
section: Food security                   
postulate: Realising globally the right to food

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data collection for the indicator was conducted by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. For this, a review of all project and programme documents on undertakings in the field of food security was carried out.<br><br>A project is counted if in the target of the impact matrix or project description a) the application of a guideline or recommendation of the Global Strategic Framework for Food Security is specifically mentioned or b) a key element with regard to the content of a guideline or recommendation is a substantial part of the undertaking and at the same time the undertaking aims to strengthen the legal, institutional or political framework. The payments must also be eligible as official development assistance (ODA). The data collected this way have been externally reviewed. This review has shown that a refined definition of governance and refined criteria for data collection are necessary to ensure comparability. Following the first collection for 2016, it is planned to compile the indicator every two years.<br><br>With 476&nbsp;million euros, the governance section represents about one third (32&nbsp;%) of ODA expenditures in the area of food security. In comparison to the total official development expenditures the governance section as well as the section of food security account only for a small share. A total of 22.4 billion euros in ODA was provided in 2016. Therefore, in the same year, 6.6&nbsp;% of ODA was allotted to food security and 2.1&nbsp;% to governance in this area.<br><br>The indicator represents a section of Germanyâ€™s contribution to achieving the SDG 2. Overall, the situation in partner countries of the German Development Cooperation had initially improved significantly in recent years. Based on values from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the proportion of people suffering from malnutrition in partner countries fell from 19&nbsp;% to 14&nbsp;% between 2000 and 2015. More recent numbers are not yet available for individual countries, so that no statement can currently be made on the latest developments in the partner countries of German Development Cooperation.<br><br>The situation had also initially improved considerably worldwide: between 2000 and 2015, the proportion of people suffering from starvation fell from 15&nbsp;% to 11&nbsp;% of the total population. According to current estimates from the FAO, the proportion of malnourished people has increased worldwide since 2015 and encompassed 821&nbsp;million in 2017. This corresponded to 11&nbsp;% of the world population. According to the FAO, the reasons for the current increase in the number of people suffering from starvation are, besides the increased occurrence of extreme weather events and climate change, in particular continuing crises and conflicts."
