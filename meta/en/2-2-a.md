#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Support for good governance in attaining appropriate nutrition worldwide    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator measures the funds disbursed for the application of the relevant international standards and recommendations on the realisation of the right to food (defined according to the Global Strategic Framework of the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS)) as a percentage of total spending on food security.<br><br><br><br>    

dns_indicator_intention: The indicator is based on the assumption that the promotion of the application of international guidelines and recommendations on food security can improve the food situation and thus make an important contribution to the fulfilment of SDG 2 and the realisation of the right to food.<br><br>The indicator measures the German contribution to enhancing good governance in the context of efforts to promote food security. The proportion of funds disbursed for food security that is used for governance is to increase accordingly by 2030.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

postulate: Realising the right to food worldwide    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Taken from the official translation of the German Sustainable Development Strategy</i><br><br>The collection of data for the indicator is undertaken by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). To this end, all project and programme documents relating to food security projects are examined. The initial survey for 2016 was reviewed externally. That validation revealed that the data collection criteria and the definition of good governance needed to be specified in order to ensure comparability of the results. The methodology was subsequently revised.<br><br>A project is now counted if the objective, the effect matrix or the project description (a) specifically names a guideline or recommendation of the Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition, or (b) a core element of the content of a guideline/recommendation is a substantial part of the project, and the project simultaneously aims to improve legal, institutional or political conditions. There must be congruity with the recording of the related spending as official development assistance (ODA).<br><br>In 2016, EUR 148 million of ODA for food security fell under the subheading of governance. On the basis of the revised methodology, this amount corresponds to 16.7% of the total expenditure of EUR 887 million. Both the total expenditure and the expenditure under the subheading of governance are thus considerably lower than the values calculated before the methodology was revised, which put governance expenditure for 2016 at 32% of a total of EUR 1,472 million. This is primarily due to a redefinition of the concept of governance and the use of an additional criterion in the form of the OECD governance indicator or, alternatively, of the governance criteria used in German development cooperation. <br><br>In 2018, a total of EUR 223 million, or 18.3% of the total expenditure of EUR 1,215 million on ODA for food security, fell under the subheading of governance. Compared with the total amount of official development assistance, however, the proportions allocated to both governance and food security are small. In 2018, for example, total spending on ODA amounted to EUR 25 billion. Of that amount, 4.9% went to food security and 0.9% to good governance within the realm of food security.<br><br>The indicator represents one facet of Germany’s contribution to the achievement of SDG 2. In recent years the overall situation in the countries with which Germany engages in development cooperation initially showed a considerable improvement. According to figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the percentage of people suffering from undernourishment in these partner countries fell from 19% in the year 2000 to 14% in 2015. Current FAO estimates, however, indicate that the undernourishment rate has been rising worldwide since 2015 and that 280 million people were undernourished in 2018. That corresponds to 11% of the world’s population.
