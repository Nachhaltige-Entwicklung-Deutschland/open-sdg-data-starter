#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Criminal offences    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of criminal offences reported to the police per 100,000 inhabitants.    

dns_indicator_intention: A safe neighbourhood in which the citizens of a country can live without fear of arbitrariness and crime is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development. Therefore, the number of recorded criminal offences per 100,000 inhabitants is to be reduced to less than 7,000 by 2030.    

indicator_name: Criminal offences    
section: Crime    
postulate: Further increasing personal security    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The indicator covers all criminal offences recorded in the Police Crime Statistics (PKS). These are criminal offences reported to the police and fully processed by them, provided that they do not involve offences against state security, traffic offences (with the exception of violations of Articles 315, 315b of the German Penal Code (StGB) and Article 22a of the Road Traffic Act (StVG)) or violations of the criminal laws of the Länder (except for the relevant regulations in the privacy laws of the Länder). Not included are criminal offences committed outside the Federal Republic of Germany as well as offences that are not within the area of responsibility of the police (e.g. financial and tax offences) or are reported directly to the public prosecutor and processed exclusively by him/her (e.g. offences relating to testimony).<br><br><br><br>The Police Crime Statistics publications are compiled annually based on the data available from the criminal police offices of the Länder and the Federal Criminal Police Office. To calculate the criminal offences per 100,000 inhabitants, the (back-calculated) population figures based on the 2011 census are used for the entire time series. This enables comparisons over time as of 1993, although these data can differ from the data of the Police Crime Statistics published for the time prior to 2013. Changes in the Police Crime Statistics do not, however, always reflect actual changes, as the statistics cover only criminal offences that officially come to the attention of the police. Since there are no statistical data on crimes that remain unknown to the police, such crimes cannot be shown in the Police Crime Statistics. If, for example, the reporting behaviour of the population changes, or the intensity with which the police pursue particular crimes, then the ratio between reported and unreported crime can change without there having been any change to the amount of actual crime committed.<br><br><br><br>The number of offences was 6,982 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 so that the target of less than 7,000 offences in 2030 has already been reached. Between 1993 and 2017, the indicator fell by 16.4&nbsp;%. However, this was not a continuous development. For example, it increased between 2000 and 2004, followed by a slight decrease until 2010. The large number of people who arrived in Germany as refugees and persons seeking asylum since 2015 is also reflected in the PKS. In 2016, violations of the legislation concerning foreigners (unauthorised entry, for example) increased by 211.8&nbsp;% compared to 2014. However, in 2017 these numbers decreased sharply and accounted for 3.1&nbsp;% of all criminal offences. Even if violations of the legislation concerning foreigners are excluded, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police in 2017 is lower than in previous years.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was 5.8 million. Domestic burglaries accounted for 2.0&nbsp;%, fraud for 15.8&nbsp;%, and dangerous and serious bodily injury for 2.4&nbsp;%. While the number of domestic burglaries decreased by 48.7&nbsp;% between 1993 and 2017, the cases of fraud increased by 72.3&nbsp;% and the cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury by 56.1&nbsp;%. When only the developments of the last five years are considered, there are deviations from the trend described above. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of domestic burglaries fell by 19.1&nbsp;% and cases of fraud by 5.0&nbsp;%, while cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury increased slightly by 0.7&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>The clear-up rate for all offences registered by the police in 2017 was 57.1&nbsp;%, and thus roughly at the previous year’s level. Considerable differences were apparent here depending on the type of criminal offence. The clear-up rate for domestic burglary, for example, was only about 17.8&nbsp;%. By contrast, 73.7&nbsp;% of fraud offences and 82.8&nbsp;% of the cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury were cleared up. The comparatively low clear-up rate for domestic burglaries is related to a high propensity to report them combined with comparatively infrequent solid leads pointing to the perpetrators. This is in sharp contrast to the cases of fraud and bodily injury. These crimes have high clear-up rates because in most cases the identity of the suspect becomes known to the police at the time the crime is reported.
