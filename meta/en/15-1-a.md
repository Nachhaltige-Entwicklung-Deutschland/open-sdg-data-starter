#Metadata                   
national_indicator_available: Biodiversity and landscape quality                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the population development for 51 selected bird species in the form of an index.                   

dns_indicator_intention: A high diversity of animal and plant species is a fundamental prerequisite for a healthy natural environment and an essential basis for human livelihood. To preserve biodiversity and at the same time the quality of life of humans, the provisional target of the Federal Government is an index value of 100 by 2030 – this target was originally supposed to be achieved by 2015. It is foreseen to check the level of this target value by 2020 and to adjust it if necessary.

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The calculation of the indicator is based upon changes in the populations of 51 bird species, which together represent the most important types of landscape and habitat in Germany: ten species each for the sub-indicators for farmland, settlements, inland waters, coasts and seas as well as eleven species for forests. As data availability is uncertain, the Alpine habitat is currently not taken into account.<br><br>The population size per species is calculated annually from the results of bird monitoring programmes by the Dachverband Deutscher Avifaunisten (DDA) in cooperation with the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) and is set in relation to the size of the target population. The value of the target population was determined by a committee of experts for each bird species - originally for the year 2015. The historical values for 1970 and 1975 have been recalculated.<br><br>For each sub-indicator, the arithmetic mean of the degrees of target achievement is calculated for all ten or eleven selected bird species. The overall indicator is calculated as a weighted sum of the sub-indicators. The weighting is based on the respective main habitat or landscape type as a share of the total area of Germany. For the time being, the target values for the sub-indicators and the overall indicator were not altered for the target year 2030.<br><br>In addition to birds, there are also other species that rely on a richly structured landscape with intact, sustainably used habitats, which means that the indicator also indirectly maps the development of a number of other species in the landscape and the sustainability of land use.<br><br>In 1990, the value of the indicator ”Biodiversity and landscape quality” was considerably lower than the values recalculated for 1970 and 1975. In the last ten reference years (2005 to 2015), the value of the indicator has deteriorated further. In 2015, it was 70.3&nbsp;% of the target value. Should this development continue, the target set for 2030 is unlikely to be achieved.<br><br>In the course of the last ten years (from 2005 to 2015), however, the sub-indicators for the individual habitat types have developed differently. Up to 2014, the sub-indicators for farmland (2015: 59.2&nbsp;% of the target value) as well as for coasts and seas (2015: 58.5&nbsp;% of the target value) showed a downward development, but have recovered slightly in 2015. This also has a considerable impact on the value of the overall indicator.<br><br>Except for the sub-indicators for forests and inland waters, all sub-indicators also remained considerably below the comparative values for 1990. In terms of biodiversity and the landscape quality of forests, the situation appeared to have improved considerably recently in comparison with the other habitat types. In 2015, this habitat achieved 90.1&nbsp;% of the target value, which was the highest value compared with the other sub-indicators."
