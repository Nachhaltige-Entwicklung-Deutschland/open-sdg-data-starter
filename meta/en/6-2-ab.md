#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Development cooperation for drinking water and sanitation    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of people in the respective reference year who received new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation as a result of German support.    

dns_indicator_intention: Inadequate provision of drinking water and sanitary facilities has far-reaching consequences for human nutrition and health. The goal of the Federal Government is therefore to give ten million people worldwide access to drinking water and sanitation each year up to 2030 with German support.    

indicator_name: Development cooperation for drinking water and sanitation    
section: Drinking water and sanitation    
postulate: Better access to drinking water and sanitation worldwide, higher (safer) quality sanitation worldwide, higher (safer) quality    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>This indicator is based on information provided by the KfW (the state-owned development bank). In this case, it is based exclusively on the planned scope of new financing commitments for projects regarding drinking water and sanitation at the time of submission of the programme proposal to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. On this basis, the KfW estimates the number of people who will in future (i.e. after the implementation of these planned projects) receive new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. The funding announced by the KfW includes subsidies and loans, refinanced from the Federal Budget, and internal market funds. The recipients are generally developing and emerging countries, which means that this indicator is related to indicator 17.1.<br><br><br><br>Due to the data structure, there is a slight overestimation (in the low single-digit percentage range) of the number of people who will have received new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation. Thus, according to the classification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), waste disposal and recycling projects are also counted as drinking water and sanitation projects.<br><br><br><br>Concrete estimates of the extent to which the planned figures are achieved, that is, whether the goal has been exceeded or the number of people reached is less than envisaged, can be made only after the relevant infrastructures have been put into operation.<br><br><br><br>Follow-up projects are evaluated as independent projects. However, if the target group of the follow-up project is identical to that of the original project, it is taken into account only once to avoid duplicate counting. Only in duly substantiated exceptional cases is it permitted to count the target group twice, for example, in scenarios where installations previously funded by the KfW are being repaired following violent confrontations or the destruction of infrastructure.<br><br><br><br>Besides the KfW, there are additional stakeholders in Germany (e.g. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, the Länder, private stakeholders), who support access to drinking water and sanitation in developing and emerging countries. The indicator therefore records only a part of the German development cooperation in the drinking water and sanitation sector. Over the past five years, the KfW’s share of total German development cooperation in the water sector has fallen steadily. In 2012 the share was 96.0&nbsp;%, while in 2016 it fell to 78.0&nbsp;%.<br><br><br><br>In previous years, the planned numbers of people who were to receive access to drinking water and sanitation with German support were always just above the set goal of ten million people. Exceptions are the years 2014 and 2017. In 2014 this was due to a nationwide programme in Mexico which, according to KfW estimates, reached considerably more people than expected. The increase in 2017 can be explained by an almost threefold increase in new financing commitments compared with 2016. If the trend recorded over the last four years is maintained, the goal will continue to be met. However, the possibility of major fluctuations due to the diverse nature of the projects cannot be ruled out in the future.
