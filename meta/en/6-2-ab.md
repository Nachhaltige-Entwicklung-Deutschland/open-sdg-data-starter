national_indicator_available: Development cooperation for access to drinking water and sanitation        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators represent the number of people reached (in millions) who have received new or improved access to drinking water (6.2.a) and/or sanitation or, since 2022, basic sanitation or wastewater treatment (6.2.b) directly through German support (<abbr title="Financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FC</abbr> commitments) in the respective reporting year.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: An inadequate supply of drinking water and sanitary facilities has far-reaching consequences for nutrition, human health and sustainable economic development in partner countries. As part of its international cooperation, the German government therefore supports projects that provide access to drinking water and sanitation.        

political_target: '6.2.a: 6 million people per year by 2030<br>6.2.b: 4 million people per year by 2030'        

type_target: '6.2.a: Consistent target every year<br>6.2.b: Consistent target every year'

indicator_name: Development cooperation for access to drinking water and sanitation        
section: Development cooperation for drinking water and sanitation        
postulate: Better access to drinking water and sanitation worldwide, higher (safer) quality

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #26bde2; font-size: large">6.2.a, b Development cooperation for access to drinking water and sanitation</b><br><br>The two indicators relating to development cooperation in the areas of drinking water and sanitation are based on data provided by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (<abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>). They reflect the number of people reached through <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>-funded projects, which are carried out under mandates from German federal ministries. Projects implemented by the <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> on behalf of, and financed by, the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>) or other countries are not included in this indicator, nor are the activities of other organisations&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title="German Agency for International Cooperation" tabindex="0">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title="Company with limited liability" tabindex="0">GmbH</abbr>, the Länder, or private actors.<br><br>Both indicators refer exclusively to the projected figures associated with new financial commitments (loan and financing agreements) for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time the contract is signed between the <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> and the partner country. The <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> estimates how many people will benefit in the future&nbsp;–&nbsp;that is, after the completion of construction&nbsp;–&nbsp;from new or improved access to drinking water and sanitation services, or from the capacities provided. However, whether these people are actually reached can only be reliably determined once the infrastructure is operational and is not reflected in the indicators themselves.<br><br>Since a person may gain improved access to both drinking water and sanitation, there may be instances of double-counting between the two indicators and over time. <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> commitments consist of grants and loans financed through the federal budget as well as funds raised on the capital market. The recipients of these funds are typically developing and emerging economies, thereby establishing a connection to Indicator 17.1, which tracks the proportion of public development expenditure in relation to gross national income.<br><br>In 2019, the methodology and data basis of the indicators were revised. Whereas both directly and indirectly reached individuals were previously included (for example via household connections and sector reform programmes, respectively), since 2019&nbsp;only directly reached individuals have been counted. To illustrate the difference: in 2017, a total of 28.6&nbsp;million people were reached, of whom 19.1&nbsp;million were reached directly. In 2018, the number of directly reached people was 15.2&nbsp;million out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million.<br><br>Another methodological change relates to multilateral projects, in which the number of people reached is now weighted according to Germany’s financial share in the overall programme.<br><br>Until 2018, the <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>’s projected figures for the number of people to gain access to drinking water and sanitation with German support consistently exceeded the politically defined target of ten million people per year. Following the methodology update, the annual target for new or improved access to drinking water has been set at six million people. With a projected figure of 10.2&nbsp;million people in 2023, this target&nbsp;–&nbsp;as in the four previous years&nbsp;–&nbsp;has been significantly surpassed.<br><br>The target for the number of people gaining new or improved basic sanitation services or wastewater treatment has been set at four million people per year since 2019. This target has only been exceeded in 2019&nbsp;and 2022. For 2023, the corresponding projected figure stands at 3.0&nbsp;million people.</p>'

data_footnotes: Due to methodological changes, the results from 2019&nbsp;are only comparable with previous years to a limited extent.<br>• Beginning in 2019, the time series for drinking water supply and sanitation will be reported separately.<br>• The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.
