national_indicator_available: Final energy consumption in goods transport        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the development of final energy consumption for the domestic transport of goods by inland waterway, rail and road compared to the base year 2015.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Transport brings with it a number of problems. For example, noise and air pollutants affect the quality of life, particularly in cities, and transport-related emissions contribute to climate change. The emission of harmful greenhouse gases (GHG) is closely linked to the energy consumed in transport.        

political_target: Reduction by 15&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;per cent by 2030&nbsp;compared to 2015        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value        

data_state: 21.05.2025        

indicator_name: Final energy consumption in goods transport        
section: Mobility        
postulate: Guaranteeing mobility&nbsp;–&nbsp;Protecting the environment

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #fd9d24; font-size: large">11.2.a Final energy consumption in goods transport</b><br><br>This indicator represents the final energy consumption (FEC) resulting from the transport of goods within Germany. Final energy refers to the energy directly used in transport&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as petrol or diesel fuel. Conversion losses during the production of fuels, as well as potential transmission losses, are not taken into account.<br><br>The underlying data is sourced from the <abbr title="Transport Emission Model" tabindex="0">TREMOD</abbr> database (Transport Emission Model) developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (<abbr title="Institute for Energy and Environmental Research" tabindex="0">ifeu</abbr>). This model is used to assess transport-related emissions and captures domestic fuel consumption, regardless of the place of refuelling. Air freight is excluded from the analysis due to its relatively minor share of total freight volume.<br><br>Due to the definitional limitation to domestic FEC, the indicator reflects the effects of increasing international economic integration of Germany’s economy only to a limited extent.<br><br>In 2023, freight transport accounted for 26.1&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> of total transport-related final energy consumption. For the first time, FEC in this sector fell below 2015&nbsp;levels&nbsp;–&nbsp;representing a 3.4&nbsp;% decline compared to the base year. The politically defined goal is to reduce FEC in freight transport by 15&nbsp;% to 20&nbsp;% between 2015&nbsp;and 2030. If recent trends continue, this target is likely to be met.<br><br>Freight transport performance measures the quantity of goods transported over a given distance, based on data from the <abbr title="Transport Emission Model" tabindex="0">TREMOD</abbr> database. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the number of tonne-kilometres travelled rose by 8.4&nbsp;%, interrupted only by a brief decline in 2020. However, by 2023, transport performance had decreased again, remaining only 2.6&nbsp;% above the 2015&nbsp;level.<br><br>In addition to absolute energy consumption, FEC is also considered in relation to freight transport performance to provide insight into energy efficiency. In 2023, FEC per tonne-kilometre stood at 94.1&nbsp;% of the 2015&nbsp;value&nbsp;–&nbsp;the lowest level in eight years.<br><br>FEC has declined across all modes of freight transport compared to 2015. The most significant reduction was recorded in inland waterways, with a decrease of 26.2&nbsp;%. In contrast, energy consumption in road freight transport dropped by only 2.8&nbsp;%, and by 1.1&nbsp;% in rail transport.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> The sum of the shares of freight transport (indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (indicator <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/11-2-b/">11.2.b</a>) in total final energy consumption in transport does not add up to 100%. This deviation results from different definitions: While the energy consumption in passenger and freight transport is based on domestic consumption (source: <abbr title="Transport Emission Model" tabindex="0">TREMOD</abbr>), the total final energy consumption in transport is based on domestic sales (source: AG Energiebilanzen).</small></p>'

target_description: 'Final energy consumption in freight transport is to be reduced to a maximum of 85&nbsp;per cent of the 2015&nbsp;level by 2030.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, for targets without an exact target value but with a target interval, the weakest target requirement (here: reduction to 85&nbsp;per cent of the 2015&nbsp;value) is regarded as the minimum politically defined target to be met. Indicator 11.2.a has developed in the desired direction on average over the last six years. If the trend continues, the minimum requirement of 85&nbsp;per cent will just be achieved. Indicator 11.2.a is rated as "Sun" for the year 2023.'
