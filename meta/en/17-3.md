national_indicator_available: Imports from least developed countries        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the imports from the least developed countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) as a proportion of all imports to Germany, measured in euros.        

dns_indicator_intention: The <abbr title="Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" tabindex="0">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic has shown what far-reaching effects cross-border health hazards have on people and economies throughout the world. Accordingly, supporting pandemic prevention and response programmes is a major contribution to global health, particularly in countries of the Global South. The aim is therefore to increase Germany’s contribution to global pandemic prevention and response substantially from its 2019&nbsp;level in the period up to 2030.
