national_indicator_available: Imports from least developed countries        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the value of imports or imports from least developed countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) as a share of total imports to Germany (in %).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: To promote global sustainable development, it is important to improve trading opportunities of developing and emerging countries. Developing and emerging countries need an open and fair trading system that will allow them to offer raw materials as well as processed products on the world market. The Federal Government has therefore set itself the target of doubling the proportion of imports from <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr> between the years 2014&nbsp;and 2030.        

political_target: Increase the proportion by 100% by 2030, compared to 2014        

type_target:

content_and_progress: "<p><b style= 'color: #19486a; font-size: large'>17.3&nbsp;Imports from least developed countries</b><br><br>Data on imports of goods into Germany are collected by the foreign trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office. These statistics record not only the country of origin of imported goods but also their value, weight, and a detailed product classification. While data on imports of services are collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank, they are not taken into account in the calculation of this indicator.<br><br>The classification of countries as Least Developed Countries (<abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr>) is based on the list of recipients of Official Development Assistance (<abbr title='Official development assistance' tabindex='0'>ODA</abbr>) maintained by the Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title='Development Assistance Committee' tabindex='0'>DAC</abbr>) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title='Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development' tabindex='0'>OECD</abbr>-DAC). For the purposes of this indicator, the applicable <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDC</abbr> classification in each respective year as defined by the <abbr title='Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development' tabindex='0'>OECD</abbr>-DAC is used. If a country's status changes, this affects the indicator&nbsp;–&nbsp;even if the import value from that country remains unchanged.<br><br>Due to re-imports&nbsp;–&nbsp;including those following processing steps abroad&nbsp;–&nbsp;a certain degree of double counting in both the numerator and denominator of the indicator must be assumed. Since imports from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> are always measured in relation to total German imports, the indicator value depends not only on the absolute volume of imports from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> but also on the total value of Germany’s imports in a given year.<br><br>In addition to total imports from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr>, the indicator also includes the share of processed goods. This is intended to partially reflect whether Germany primarily imports raw materials from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> for industrial production or whether <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> themselves are involved in the manufacturing process and value creation. Processed goods are defined as all products that are not classified as raw materials according to the grouping by product categories and subcategories of the food and manufacturing industries (<abbr title='Classification by Commodity Groups and Subgroups of the Food Industry and Trade and Industry' tabindex='0'>EGW</abbr>). Raw materials such as crude oil, ores, roundwood or vegetable textile fibres are excluded, whereas items such as cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are considered processed products.<br><br>In 2024, according to preliminary calculations, the share of imports from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> in total German imports amounted to 1.17%, or 15.3&nbsp;billion euros. This represents an increase of 64.0% since 2014&nbsp;(2014: 0.71%). The share of processed products from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> grew by 60.1% between 2014&nbsp;and 2024, reaching 1.05% of total German imports in 2024&nbsp;(2014: 0.66%). This corresponds to a value of 13.8&nbsp;billion euros. Despite a temporary decline in 2023, the indicator overall moved in the desired direction and, if the current trend continues, is on track to meet the politically defined target for 2030.<br><br>A more detailed analysis of imports by country of origin shows that in 2024, the majority of imports from <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> originated from Bangladesh (55.0%) and Cambodia (14.4%). When considering not only the <abbr title='Least developed countries' tabindex='0'>LDCs</abbr> but all developing and emerging economies, their share of total German imports in 2024&nbsp;stood at 25.8%, with processed goods accounting for 23.6%.<br><br>Among developing and emerging economies&nbsp;–&nbsp;and indeed across all countries&nbsp;–&nbsp;Germany imported the most from China in 2024. The share of imports from China in total German imports (1,307.8&nbsp;billion euros) amounted to 11.9%, with 99.7% of the value attributable to processed goods. The Netherlands (7.2%) and the United States (7.0%) followed as the second and third most important import partners respectively.</p>"

target_description: Imports from least developed countries should be increased to at least 1.43% by 2030&nbsp;(an increase of 100% compared to 2014).<br><br><br>• According to the target formulation, if the average development observed over the past six years continues, the politically defined target will be achieved.
