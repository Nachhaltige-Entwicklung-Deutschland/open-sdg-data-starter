national_indicator_available: Equivalised disposable income (Gini coefficient)                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the distribution of equivalised disposable income per person using Gini coefficients.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Inequality in income and wealth distribution is a generally accepted component of a dynamic market economy. However, the income and wealth gap must remain moderate and social inclusion be guaranteed for all. The goal is to keep the Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable income below the EU average by means of suitable framework conditions as well as a targeted re-distribution of income through taxes and social benefits.                   

indicator_name: Gini coefficient of income distribution

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of income inequality. It has a value between 0 and 1. The value 0 means that every person has exactly the same income whereas the value 1 indicates that only one person receives all the income, thereby representing a situation of maximum income inequality. However, the Gini coefficient of income distribution does not take into account which sources are used to generate income (e.g. wages, income from rent or income from capital).<br><br>The equivalised income is a value derived from the total income of a household and the number and age of the people living from this income. With the help of an equivalence scale, the incomes are weighted according to household size and composition, as the shared use of living space and household appliances results in efficiency gains. This approach makes it possible to compare incomes irrespective of the household size or the age of the household members because the equivalised income is allocated equally to each household member. The equivalised disposable income is a household’s income including social transfers, after taxes and other deductions, and is therefore the income available for expenditures and savings. A distinction must be made between this measure and the equivalised income before social transfers on the one hand, which looks at the disposable income without possible social transfers (e.g. unemployment benefits, housing assistance), and market income on the other, which is calculated before taxes, social contributions and social benefits.<br><br>The initial data for equivalised income are taken from the Europe-wide harmonised annual statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC), the data on income distribution come from the “Household Finance and Consumption Survey” (HFCS) conducted at irregular intervals by the European Central Bank. The fact that households with high income and extensive assets are under-represented in voluntary sample surveys is methodologically compensated for. Therefore, the values for income as well as for assets in Germany are comparable to those of Europe and the Eurozone in terms of methodology. Beyond this, no equivalent, methodologically harmonised and verifiable internationally comparative values are available. Since EU-SILC is not yet drawn upon to calculate a Gini coefficient for market income, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) of the German Institute for Economic Research are used for this purpose.<br><br>As in previous years, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income for Germany (0.295) almost equals that for the European Union (0.308) and shows a stable pattern over the years. Thus, there are no significant differences in income distribution between Germany and Europe. Furthermore, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income is well below the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income before social benefits without pensions (0.295 as compared with 0.359). As expected, the Gini coefficient of market income was even higher at 0.504 (2015). In Germany, social benefits, social insurance and taxes thus contribute considerably to reducing inequalities in disposable income.<br><br>Turning to the corresponding Gini coefficient (2014: 0.76), wealth in Germany is much less evenly distributed than income. In this context, hardly any change can be detected over time (2010: 0.76). The gap to the respective European value (Eurozone 2010: 0.69) is substantial. However, the impression of there being a disproportionately high wealth inequality is qualified by several factors not covered by the Gini coefficient. For instance, the evaluation of wealth does not take into account future pension entitlements. In addition, due to the stricter protection of tenants’ rights, people in Germany are more likely to rent than own their homes, compared to other European countries."
