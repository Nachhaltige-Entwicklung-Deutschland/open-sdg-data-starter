dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the population trends for 41&nbsp;selected bird species in the form of an index. The indicator summarises the changes in the populations of selected bird species that represent the most important types of land use and landscape in Germany (sub-indicators for farmland, forests, settlements and inland waters).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: A large diversity of animal and plant species is an essential prerequisite for an efficient ecosystem and forms an important basis of human life. If the quality of the habitats increases as a result of a reduction in pressures, an improvement in the sustainability of utilisation or the successful implementation of nature conservation measures, this is reflected in increasing numbers of the selected bird species and thus in a positive development of the indicator. As other species besides birds are also linked to a richly structured landscape with intact, sustainably utilised habitats, the indicator also indirectly reflects the development of numerous other species in the landscape and the sustainability of land use.        

political_target: Reach the index value of 100&nbsp;by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #56c02b; font-size: large">15.1&nbsp;Biodiversity and landscape quality</b><br><br>The indicator for biodiversity and landscape quality approximates biodiversity as well as landscape quality by means of population trends of selected bird species. It depicts the population development of 41&nbsp;bird species that are representative of the main landscape and habitat types in Germany. For the sub-indicators "forests", "settlements", and "inland waters", ten species are used respectively, while "agricultural land" is represented by eleven species. The sub-indicators "coasts and seas" (also ten bird species) and "Alps" are additionally presented, as their developments are particularly influenced by specific conservation measures. However, the landscape type "Alps" is currently not depicted due to insufficient data availability.<br><br>Population sizes of the bird species are recorded annually within monitoring programmes conducted by the Dachverband Deutscher Avifaunisten (<abbr title="Federation of German Avifaunists" tabindex="0">DDA</abbr>) in cooperation with the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (<abbr title="Federal Agency for Nature Conservation" tabindex="0">BfN</abbr>) and are each related to defined target values. These target values for the year 2030&nbsp;were species-specifically defined by an expert panel within a research and development project. Historical reference values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975&nbsp;were reconstructed based on the Red Lists.<br><br>For each sub-indicator, the arithmetic mean of target achievement across the respective ten or eleven species considered is calculated. The overall indicator results from a weighted sum of the sub-indicators, with the weighting factors corresponding to the area shares of the respective main habitat or landscape types (agricultural land: 49&nbsp;%, forests: 29&nbsp;%, settlements: 13&nbsp;%, inland waters: 9&nbsp;%).<br><br>Between 2019&nbsp;and 2022, the indicator was retrospectively reviewed and revised as part of a research and development project of the <abbr title="Federal Agency for Nature Conservation" tabindex="0">BfN</abbr>. Both the target values and the species selection were updated to reflect current conditions. Consequently, the time series were recalculated retrospectively.<br><br>Although the indicator is based on bird species, it indirectly reflects the development of numerous other species as well as the sustainability of land use, since many species depend on intact and sustainably managed habitats.<br><br>The overall indicator value in 1990&nbsp;was significantly below the reconstructed values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975. In the last ten reporting years (2009&nbsp;to 2019), the decline continued: the indicator value decreased from 82.5&nbsp;% of the target value in 2009&nbsp;to 75.3&nbsp;% in 2019. If this trend continues, the politically established target for 2030&nbsp;is unlikely to be achieved.<br><br>The development of the sub-indicators for the different habitat types varied over the same period: the sub-indicator for agricultural land fell from 92.3&nbsp;% in 2009&nbsp;to 69.9&nbsp;% in 2019, while that for inland waters decreased from 84.9&nbsp;% to 79.9&nbsp;%.<br><br>In contrast, the sub-indicators for forests and settlements showed positive trends: the sub-indicator for forests increased from 70.1&nbsp;% (2009) to 80.9&nbsp;% (2019), and that for settlements improved from 72.0&nbsp;% to 80.3&nbsp;% over the same period.<br><br>The sub-indicator for coasts and seas, which is not included in the overall indicator, recorded a decline from 91.3&nbsp;% in 2008&nbsp;to 77.6&nbsp;% in 2018. Data for 2019&nbsp;were not available at the time of publication.</p>'
