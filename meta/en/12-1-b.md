national_indicator_available: Energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by households                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the development of direct and indirect energy consumption by households and thus illustrates the strain placed on energy by the consumption activities of households.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Households are responsible for a substantial share of the energy consumption in an economy as well as the carbon dioxide emissions that are closely linked to energy consumption. However, energy consumption is not confined to the domestic economy alone, but also extends to the production of imported goods abroad. The indicator therefore provides additional information on the global environmental impact of consumption activities. A reduction in energy consumption will conserve resources both domestically and abroad and will curb carbon dioxide emissions that are harmful to the environment. The goal of the Federal Government is therefore to continuously lower energy consumption associated with consumption.                   

indicator_name: Energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from consumption                   
section: Responsible consumption                   
postulate: Making consumption environmentally and socially compatible                   

#Content                    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data are derived from the environmental-economic accounts of the Federal Statistical Office based on the energy balances from the AGEB (Energy Balance Association) and on the emission reporting of the German Environment Agency.<br><br>Households consume energy directly, for example, for heating or through the consumption of fuels for road transport. In addition to this direct energy consumption, substantial amounts of energy are consumed in the production of goods for private consumption. This indirect energy consumption occurs domestically and abroad, among both the direct producers of the consumer goods and their suppliers. Both forms are recorded by this indicator.<br><br>The same applies to the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), presented here as an index for information purposes. In addition to the direct emissions by households caused by the combustion of fuels, much greater quantities of emissions are generated indirectly during the production of consumer goods. The depicted key figure includes both direct as well as indirect emissions.<br><br>Closer analysis of the time series reveals a wavelike trend in energy consumption due to the consumption activities of households with a slight increase of 1.9&nbsp;% from 2005 until 2010. Between 2010 and 2012, energy consumption by households declined steadily by a total of 5.3&nbsp;%. In 2013, however, consumption increased by 1.9&nbsp;% year on year, while in 2014 it decreased by 6.2&nbsp;% compared with the previous year. According to provisional results, energy consumption in 2015 increased again by 2.0&nbsp;% year on year. The value of the indicator in 2015 decreased by a total of 5.7&nbsp;% compared with 2005. However, there are currently no signs of a continuous reduction.<br><br>In 2015, direct energy consumption by households accounted for 39.2&nbsp;% of overall household energy consumption. Of this amount, energy sources including electricity and district heating accounted for 62.6&nbsp;% and fuels for 37.4&nbsp;%. The greater proportion of overall energy consumption at 60.8&nbsp;% was indirect energy consumption associated with the production of consumer goods domestically and abroad.<br><br>Energy consumption is differentiated according to areas of demand such as housing, mobility, food, other products and services. Most energy is consumed in the sectors of housing, transport and food. In 2015, housing was the sector with the highest consumption of roughly 3,324 petajoules (35.6&nbsp;% of total household consumption). The losses occurring during the generation of electricity and district heating for households are included here as indirect consumption.<br><br>The development of energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions shows a pattern similar to that of energy consumption. In 2015, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by households, including the emission content of consumer goods and emissions from the combustion of biomass, amounted to 638&nbsp;million tonnes, which was thus a 1.0% decline compared with 2005. The combustion of fuels accounted for 33.3&nbsp;% of emissions, with the remaining 66.7&nbsp;% accounted for by the production of consumer goods. Between 2005 and 2015, direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions decreased by 2.5&nbsp;%, although the emission content of consumer goods increased by 2.5&nbsp;%.
