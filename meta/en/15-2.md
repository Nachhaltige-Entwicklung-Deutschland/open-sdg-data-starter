national_indicator_available: Eutrophication of ecosystems        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the proportion of the area of sensitive terrestrial ecosystems (in per cent) where the ecological critical loads were exceeded due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition, measured against the total assessed area of sensitive ecosystems.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The ecological load limits are a measure of the sensitivity of an ecosystem to the input of a pollutant. If the input of air pollutants is below these critical loads, no harmful effects on the structure and function of an ecosystem are to be expected according to the current state of knowledge. Almost half of all ferns and flowering plants on the Red List in Germany are endangered by nutrient inputs.        

political_target: Reduction by 35&nbsp;per cent by 2030&nbsp;compared to 2005        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value        

data_state: 15.01.2025        

indicator_name: Eutrophication of ecosystems        
section: Ecosystems        
postulate: Protecting ecosystems, conserving ecosystem services and preserving habitats

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #56c02b; font-size: large">15.2&nbsp;Eutrophication of ecosystems</b><br><br>Nitrogen, which enters the atmosphere in the form of ammonia or nitrogen oxides, can be deposited into ecosystems as a gas, dissolved in rain, or as a component of particulate matter.<br><br>Excessive deposition of nitrogen compounds from the air into terrestrial ecosystems can lead to nutrient imbalances. This affects, among other things, species composition: plant species that prefer nitrogen-poor sites are displaced by nitrogen-loving species. Furthermore, altered nutrient availability increases the susceptibility of many plants to frost, drought, or pests. The consequences of elevated nitrogen deposition often manifest only with a temporal delay. Similarly, positive effects of reduced deposition frequently only become apparent after several years.<br><br>Emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides, which are recorded in Indicator 3.2.a “Emissions of Air Pollutants,” have a direct impact on the eutrophication of ecosystems. Ecosystems included in the indicator’s calculation comprise in particular forests, semi-natural grasslands, bogs, marshes, and heaths.<br><br>Ecosystem-specific critical loads are used to assess nitrogen deposition. When these limits are adhered to, the structure, function, and species communities of an ecosystem are preserved according to current scientific understanding. Approximately eleven million hectares are assessed in this manner, representing nearly one third of Germany’s total area.<br><br>In 2019, nitrogen deposition exceeded the critical loads on 69&nbsp;% of the assessed sensitive ecosystems in Germany. Particularly high exceedances occur in parts of northern Germany, where intensive agriculture releases large amounts of reactive nitrogen compounds.<br><br>Between 2000&nbsp;and 2015, the proportion of affected areas was reduced by 15&nbsp;percentage points. Since then, no further reduction in the share of impacted areas has been observed.<br><br>The calculation of the indicator is performed by the German Environment Agency (<abbr title="Federal Environment Agency" tabindex="0">UBA</abbr>) and is based on two datasets: The first is the Critical Load dataset provided by the <abbr title="Federal Environment Agency" tabindex="0">UBA</abbr> within the framework of international reporting to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (<abbr title="Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution" tabindex="0">CLRTAP</abbr>). This is based, among other data, on the soil overview map of Germany, the map of average annual leachate rates, land use distribution, and climate data. The second dataset comprises a time series of nitrogen deposition in Germany, calculated within the framework of the <abbr title="Pollutant INput and EcosysTem Impact" tabindex="0">PINETI</abbr> IV project (Pollutant INput and EcosysTem Impact).</p>'

target_description: The proportion of sensitive terrestrial ecosystems that exceed the eutrophication thresholds is to be reduced to a maximum of 52&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br>Based on the target formulation, indicator 15.2&nbsp;will be around 60&nbsp;per cent in 2030&nbsp;if the trend of the last six years continues. Due to the large gap to the politically defined target value, indicator 15.2&nbsp;is rated as "Cloud" for 2019.
