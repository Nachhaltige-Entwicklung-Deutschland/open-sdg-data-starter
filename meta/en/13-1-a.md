#content         
content_and_progress: "<p><b style= 'color: #3f7e44; font-size: large'>13.1.a Greenhouse gas emissions</b><br><br>The global greenhouse effect arises from the impact of various gases on the Earth's atmosphere: short-wave solar radiation passes through almost unhindered and is re-emitted by the Earth's surface as long-wave infrared radiation. This thermal radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases (GHGs) and re-emitted at various wavelengths.<br><br>Depending on the gas, absorption behaviour and atmospheric lifetime vary. Therefore, individual greenhouse gases contribute to the greenhouse effect to different extents. To make their impact comparable, it is expressed in so-called “CO₂ equivalents”.<br><br>The year 1990&nbsp;is used as the reference year for evaluating the development of greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>The indicator records emissions of the most significant greenhouse gases caused by human activity: carbon dioxide (<abbr title='Carbon dioxide' tabindex='0'>CO₂</abbr>), methane (<abbr title='Methane' tabindex='0'>CH₄</abbr>), nitrous oxide (<abbr title='Nitrous oxide' tabindex='0'>N₂O</abbr>), nitrogen trifluoride (<abbr title='Nitrogen trifluoride' tabindex='0'>NF₃</abbr>), hydrofluorocarbons (<abbr title='Hydrofluorocarbons' tabindex='0'>HFCs</abbr>), perfluorocarbons (<abbr title='Perfluorocarbons' tabindex='0'>PFCs</abbr>), and sulphur hexafluoride (<abbr title='Sulphur hexafluoride' tabindex='0'>SF₆</abbr>).<br><br>The annual collection and reporting of emissions data is conducted by the Federal Environment Agency (<abbr title='Federal Environment Agency' tabindex='0'>UBA</abbr>) as part of international obligations&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as under the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<abbr title='United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change' tabindex='0'>UNFCCC</abbr>), and the Federal Climate Change Act (Bundes-Klimaschutzgesetz).<br><br>The calculation follows the “polluter pays” and territorial principles, whereby relevant emission sources within Germany are recorded. Emissions from international maritime shipping and aviation are excluded. Emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (<abbr title='Land use, land-use change and forestry' tabindex='0'>LULUCF</abbr>) are also not included in the indicator, in accordance with an agreement under the Kyoto Protocol. The <abbr title='Land use, land-use change and forestry' tabindex='0'>LULUCF</abbr> sector includes both emissions and removals of greenhouse gases through forests, arable land, grassland and wetlands.<br><br>Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions in Germany have shown a long-term decline, interrupted only occasionally by temporary increases. Notable reductions occurred in 2009&nbsp;as a result of the global financial and economic crisis, and again in 2020&nbsp;due to pandemic-related effects such as reduced economic activity and passenger transport. As a result, the politically set target to reduce emissions by 2020&nbsp;to below 60% of the 1990&nbsp;level was achieved.<br><br>According to preliminary calculations by the <abbr title='Federal Environment Agency' tabindex='0'>UBA</abbr>, greenhouse gas emissions fell by 48.2% between 1990&nbsp;and 2024. In 2024, approximately 649&nbsp;million tonnes of greenhouse gases were emitted, representing a decline of about 23&nbsp;million tonnes or 3.4% compared to the previous year.<br><br>If the trend of recent years continues, the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 35% of the 1990&nbsp;level by 2030&nbsp;is likely to be narrowly missed.<br><br>In 2023, 88.4% of total greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to carbon dioxide (<abbr title='Carbon dioxide' tabindex='0'>CO₂</abbr>), 6.7% to methane (<abbr title='Methane' tabindex='0'>CH₄</abbr>), 3.6% to nitrous oxide (<abbr title='Nitrous oxide' tabindex='0'>N₂O</abbr>), and 1.4% to fluorinated greenhouse gases. <abbr title='Carbon dioxide' tabindex='0'>CO₂</abbr> emissions predominantly result from electricity and heat generation, while methane and nitrous oxide emissions primarily originate from agriculture.<br><br>In 2024, the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions was attributed to the energy sector (28.5%). Industry accounted for 23.6%, transport for 22.0%, and the buildings sector for 15.5%. The remaining 10.4% was mainly attributed to agriculture, waste management, and other emitters.<br><br>Over the long-term comparison between 2023&nbsp;and 1990, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Germany stands at 46%, significantly higher than the preliminary average reduction across the European Union (<abbr title='European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)' tabindex='0'>EU-27</abbr>), which is around 36%. Even greater reductions have been recorded in some Central and Eastern European countries&nbsp;–&nbsp;especially in the Baltic States: Estonia (–73%), Latvia and Lithuania (each –62%). With the exception of Cyprus (+52%), all Member States have managed to reduce their emissions. Compared to the previous year, when Ireland (+13%) and Spain (+6%) had still reported increases, a decline was also observed here&nbsp;–&nbsp;by 6% in Spain and 1% in Ireland.</p>"

target_description: Various targets are defined for indicator 13.1.a, which are to be achieved in different years. The politically defined target that is closest to the future is relevant for the assessment of the indicator. Greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced to a maximum of 35&nbsp;per cent of the 1990&nbsp;level by 2030.<br>If the trend of the last six years is maintained, the politically defined target value will be narrowly missed in 2030, meaning that indicator 13.1.a for the year 2024&nbsp;is rated as "slightly cloudy".
