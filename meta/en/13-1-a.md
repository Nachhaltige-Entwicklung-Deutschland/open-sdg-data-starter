national_indicator_available: Greenhouse gas emissions in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents                   

dns_indicator_definition: "The indicator at federal level shows emissions of the following greenhouse gases (substances or substance groups) in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), laughing gas (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitrogen triflouride (NF<sub>3</sub>), hydroflourocarbons (HFC), perflourocarbons (PFC) as well as sulphur hexaflouride (SF<sub>6</sub>)."                   

dns_indicator_intention: The global average temperature on the surface of the Earth is continuously rising due to the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is already having detectable consequences on the climate system today. The Federal Government therefore aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by at least 40&nbsp;% compared with 1990 by 2020. Additional targets are the reduction by at least 55&nbsp;% by 2030, by at least 70&nbsp;% by 2040 and by 80 to 95&nbsp;% by 2050 – in each case compared with 1990.

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>To summarise the various greenhouse gases into a single index, they are each expressed in “CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents”, which means that they are converted into the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> that would have a comparable impact on global warming. Because of cumulation, however, the development of the individual greenhouse gases cannot be determined. A negative development of one greenhouse gas can for instance be concealed by a positive development of another greenhouse gas.<br><br>The data are provided annually by the German Environment Agency as part of the reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The determination and reporting of emissions is subject to a comprehensive quality management system.<br><br>The calculation is made according to the polluter pays and territorial concept. This means that the most important sources of emissions in Germany are identified for all greenhouse gases and air pollutants. For these sources the level of emissions under certain conditions was determined. As a result, a specific emissions factor is obtained, which is then multiplied by the activity data of a source to quantify the amount of emissions.<br><br>Note that the indicator according to the Kyoto Protocol does not show the carbon dioxide emissions arising from land use, land use change and forestry. Sea transport and international air transport are also excluded from the calculation.<br><br>A closer look at the development over the last five years shows that the indicator has not developed in a stable manner. In 2013, the emission values of greenhouse gases increased by 1.4&nbsp;%, while they decreased considerably by 3.1&nbsp;% in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, they again increased slightly by 0.3&nbsp;% and 0.2&nbsp;%, respectively. In the long run, as was shown by the near real time forecast of the German Environment Agency in 2017, a decline of a total of 27.7&nbsp;% compared with 1990 can be observed. If the development recorded over the last five years continues, it is unlikely that the target set for 2020 – a 40% reduction compared with 1990 – can be achieved.<br><br>Carbon dioxide accounted for the by far largest proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (88.1&nbsp;%), compared with 84.1&nbsp;% in 1990. Methane contributed 6.0&nbsp;%, laughing gas 4.2&nbsp;%, hydroflourocarbons 1.2&nbsp;% and sulphur hexaflouride 0.4&nbsp;% to the greenhouse gas emissions (last two figures for 2016). By far the largest part of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is created by the generation of electricity and heat. Methane and laughing gas are emitted primarily by agricultural production.<br><br>The indicator has cross references, for instance, to indicators 3.2 “Air pollution”, 7.2 “Renewable energies” and 11.2 “Mobility”.
