national_indicator_available: Expansion of settlement and transport area                   

dns_indicator_definition: 'The indicator shows the average daily expansion of the settlement and transport area.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>'                   

dns_indicator_intention: 'Land is a limited resource. Agriculture and forestry, settlement and transport, nature conservation, raw material extraction and energy generation compete for its use. The use of additional land for settlement and transport purposes is intended to be limited to below 30 hectares per day by 2030.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>'

content_and_progress: '"The settlement and transport area should not be mistaken for sealed land. Settlement and transport includes the following types of land use: building and adjacent open area, commercial or industrial area (excluding exploitation area), transport area, recreation area and cemeteries. The indicator does not focus on sealed land, instead it also covers non-built-up and unsealed land such as gardens, yard areas and landscape surrounding transport infrastructure as well as open spaces such as parks and other green spaces, allotment gardens, garden land within towns, sports and leisure facilities, camp sites as well as cemeteries. According to calculations of the environmental-economic accounts of the Länder, the average sealed proportion of the settlement and transport area in the Länder is estimated at just over 45&nbsp;% (2013).<br><br>The data source for the indicator is the area survey by type of actual use in the official land registers of the Länder. Changes in the methodology of the official land registers in previous years have increasingly resulted in the reclassification of land not caused by real changes of use. In order to partially offset the resulting distortion, a moving average is formed, in each case, from the four preceding years to enable the evaluation of the relevant development.<br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. For this reason, the development of the indicator in 2016 is shown only as a four-year moving average.<br><br>Between 1992 and 2015, 8,761 km² of land were converted for use as settlement and transport area. As a result, the settlement and transport area expanded by 21.7&nbsp;% compared to 1992; the settlement area by 29.7&nbsp;% and transport area by 10.1&nbsp;%.<br><br>In recent years, this increase in the amount of settlement and transport area has noticeably slowed down. In 2015, the four-year moving average for land used for the first time for settlement and transport purposes was 66 hectares per day, compared to 120 hectares per day at the start of the time series. If the average trend of the previous five years is maintained, the originally specified goal of 30 hectares per day, which is supposed to be reached by 2020, will be achieved in 2030. In 2016, the four-year moving average decreased further to a value of 62 hectares for newly occupied settlement and transport areas. <br><br>From 2005 to 2009, the development of the settlement area was temporarily dominated by high growth rates in the “recreation area, cemeteries” type of land use. The relevant extent does not reflect any real changes in the landscape and can be attributed, among other things, to the above-mentioned changes in the land register. In 2015, the recreation area and cemeteries accounted for 9.8&nbsp;% of the settlement and transport area, with the increase in cemeteries being only marginal. From 2012 to 2014, the transport area increased considerably again, but declined in 2015.<br><br>In 2015, the settlement and transport area totalled 49,066 km² and accounted for 13.7&nbsp;% of Germany’s total area. The largest type of land use in Germany is the agricultural area with 184,332 km² (51.6&nbsp;%), followed by the wooded area with 109,515 km² (30.6&nbsp;%). In the reference period from 1992 to 2015, the wooded area increased by 4,979 km², while the agricultural area decreased by 10,780 km². It can thus be assumed that the increase in the settlement and transport area was  primarily at the expense of agricultural areas."<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>'
