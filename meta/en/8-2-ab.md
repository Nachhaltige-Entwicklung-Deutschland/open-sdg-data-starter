#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Government deficit, structural deficit    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators show the financial balance of general government (deficit or surplus) and the structural financial balance in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices. The financial balance of general government is calculated from government revenue minus government expenditure in line with the national accounts. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that cannot be attributed to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects.    

dns_indicator_intention: Sound public finances represent an essential element of a sustainable financial policy. A policy that relies too heavily on borrowing to fund current public expenditure and then passes this debt on to future generations is simply not sustainable. <br><br><br><br>According to the convergence criteria for the European Union (referred to as the Maastricht Criteria), the annual government deficit should be less than 3&nbsp;% of GDP. The structural deficit must not exceed 0.5&nbsp;% of GDP. These are the stipulations of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany’s Basic Law since 2009 (Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The calculation of GDP and the financial balance of general government is specified by the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) and is conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. Whereas the structural financial balance is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The calculation of the government deficit takes into account the finances of the territorial authorities, that is, central, state and local government (Federation, Länder and municipalities), and the finances of the social security funds. Additional units (so-called extra budgets) – such as the German Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, which must be allocated to the general government sector according to the ESA – are also included. The values are based mainly on the financial results of the federal budget according to information provided by the Federal Ministry of Finance and, for state and local government, on the quarterly cash results of public finance statistics.<br><br><br><br>In 2014, total general government reported a surplus of 16.7 billion euros – the first positive result since the financial market and economic crisis in 2008/2009. In 2017 the financial surplus amounted to 34.0 billion euros. The central government (Federation) surplus was 6.1 billion euros. At the same time, the state government (Länder) again reported a surplus (8.3 billion euros). The results from local government (municipalities) (9.5 billion euros) and the social security funds (10.1 billion euros) were also positive. The overall government budget in 2017 showed a structural surplus of 1.5&nbsp;% (provisional results) of GDP. As a result, the Maastricht Criteria of the EU regarding the government deficit as well as the structural deficit have been met since 2012.<br><br><br><br>Viewed over the entire period from 1991 to 2017, government revenue grew more strongly (116.0&nbsp;%) than GDP at current prices (107.5&nbsp;%) and expenditure (96.6&nbsp;%). Consequently, the share of government revenue in GDP increased from 43.2&nbsp;% to 45.0&nbsp;%. However, higher revenue growth became apparent only from 2011 onwards.<br><br><br><br>Expenditure showed a disproportionate increase in social benefits in kind. These have increased by 176.7&nbsp;% since 1991, whereas the largest item on the expenditure side –social benefits other than social transfers in kind – recorded an increase of 114.9&nbsp;%, which was only slightly higher than GDP growth (107.5&nbsp;%). Around 70&nbsp;% of social benefits other than social transfers in kind are accounted for by social security funds, primarily in the form of pensions and unemployment benefits. From 2003 onwards, the social benefits other than social transfers in kind fell from 18.4&nbsp;% of GDP to 15.4&nbsp;%, which can be primarily attributed to sharp reductions in unemployment insurance payments. These fell by roughly 24 billion euros between 2003 and 2017 as a result of the Hartz legislation and an upturn in the labour market.
