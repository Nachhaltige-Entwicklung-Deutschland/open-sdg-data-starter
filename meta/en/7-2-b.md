national_indicator_available: Electricity generated from renewable energy sources                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator reflects the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Switching to renewable energies (natural energy sources that constantly regenerate) can reduce the demand for fossil fuels. As a result, the dependency on imports of conventional fuels would be reduced, as would energy-related emissions, and hence the extent of climate change would be mitigated. According to the energy concept of the Federal Government, the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption should therefore increase to at least 35&nbsp;% by 2020, at least 50&nbsp;% by 2030 and at least 80&nbsp;% by 2050.                   

indicator_name: Share of electricity from renewable energy sources in electricity consumption                   
section: Renewable energies                   
postulate: Strengthening a sustainable energy supply

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energies Statistics (AGEE-Stat) based on different official and unofficial sources. Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the amount of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the domestic electricity generation, the balance of exchanges across national borders, the self-consumption of power plants as well as transmission losses. The following are considered to be renewable energy sources: wind energy, hydropower, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and gas from purification plants as well as the bio-degradable proportion of waste from households and the industry.<br><br>During the period from 1990 to 2017, the share of renewable energy in electricity consumption increased from 3.4&nbsp;% to 36.0&nbsp;%. The goal of achieving 35&nbsp;% by 2020 thus was already reached in 2017. This trend has been driven by legal measures, such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). The EEG requires, among other things, network operators to give priority feed-in to renewable energy.<br><br>Similarly to indicator 7.2.a, it should be noted with regard to the methodology used to calculate the indicator that foreign trade of electricity has a direct influence on the denominator of the indicator, but not on the numerator. 1 Regardless of electricity generation from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. For 15 years, Germany has been a growing net exporter of electricity (in 2016: 8.5&nbsp;% of the gross electricity consumption). As a result, the indicator overestimates the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption over the same time period.<br><br>Since 2000, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation has risen, in particular due to the increased use of wind energy, biomass and photovoltaics. In the period between 2000 and 2017, a slight downward trend in the generation of electricity from conventional fuels coincided with an increase of more than 180 TWh in the production of renewable electricity. Specifically, electricity generation by means of wind energy on land and at sea was up from 9.7 TWh in 2000 to 105.7 TWh in 2017. The share accounted for by wind energy at sea in 2017 was approximately 17.7 TWh. Electricity generation from photovoltaics rose from 0.06 TWh in 2000 to 39.4 TWh in 2017. Electricity generation from biomass has increased to 50.9 TWh, that is, more than tenfold in the same period."
