national_indicator_available: Germany's climate finance flows primarily to developing and emerging countries                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the financing of measures to reduce greenhouse gases (for instance through the conservation and reforestation of forests (REDD+)), to adapt to climate change and to protect biodiversity. Funding goes primarily to developing and emerging countries and is made from German budget funds, including grant elements of development loans which include budget funds.                   

dns_indicator_intention: The Federal Government intends to double its international climate finance from budget funds and grant elements of development loans to 4 billion euros by 2020 relative to the 2014 target figure of 2 billion euros. In the decision text accompanying the Paris Climate Agreement, the industrialised countries’ commitment of 2009 was confirmed, namely to mobilise – from 2020 onwards – 100 billion US dollars from public and private sources for climate protection and adaptation to climate change in developing countries.                   

indicator_name: International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change

postulate: Germany’s contribution to international climate finance                   

#Content                    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data for the indicator are taken from the reporting in accordance with the EU Regulation on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. The data source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which in this context also reports on climate financing by other federal ministries. In general, the information on bilateral climate finance is based on the relevant commitments, while the actual payments are taken as a basis for multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds. The indicator also includes the proportionately attributed climate finance derived from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks. If climate finance mainly benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development assistance (see indicator 17.1).<br><br>In 2017, Germany committed or provided 3.6 billion euros from budget funds for international climate finance to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change. Compared to the previous year, during which climate finance amounted to 3.4 billion euros, this represents an increase of 8.6&nbsp;%. A proportion of 43&nbsp;% of climate financing in 2017 was spent on emission reduction and 25&nbsp;% on adaptation to climate change. The remaining 32&nbsp;% were used to finance cross-sectoral projects. As in previous years, more funds were spent on mitigation than on adaptation projects in 2017.<br><br>Multilateral channels provided 13&nbsp;% (481&nbsp;million euros) of climate finance in 2017. Of this amount, 187&nbsp;million euros represent the climate finance allocated proporotionately to Germany, which results from contributions to multilateral funds at development banks.<br><br>The purely monetary analysis of climate finance does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of the financed projects. Based on its resources for technical and financial cooperation, the BMZ assesses how many tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will be saved in the future through mitigation projects. The impact assessments of financial cooperation are based on ex-ante estimates of the financing commitments of a year, while those of technical cooperation are calculated on an ex-post basis.<br><br>In 2017, direct savings of 8.7&nbsp;million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were achieved usingfinancial cooperation funds. Through technical cooperation funds, emissions of 9.1&nbsp;million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents were directly avoided between 2015 and 2017.<br><br>In addition to public climate financing from budget funds, the KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau) and the DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans via market funds. These represent the “mobilised public climate finance” which is not included in the indicator. In 2017, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to 3.1 billion euros compared to 5.2 billion euros in the previous year. Here again, more funds were disbursed for mitigation projects (83&nbsp;%) than for adaptation projects (9&nbsp;%).
