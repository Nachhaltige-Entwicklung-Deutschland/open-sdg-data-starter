national_indicator_available: International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change        

dns_indicator_definition: This indicator covers the financing of measures to reduce greenhouse gases, adapt to climate change and/or take climate-related action to preserve biodiversity and protect forests (specifically, projects for the conservation and sustainable management of forests as well as reforestation within the <abbr title="Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation" tabindex="0">REDD</abbr>+&nbsp;framework). The measures chiefly take place in developing and emerging countries and are financed using German budget funds (including grant elements of development loans since 2017).        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the financing of measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), adapt to climate change and climate-relevant measures to preserve biodiversity and protect forests (projects for the conservation, sustainable use and reforestation of forests under the <abbr title="Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation" tabindex="0">REDD</abbr>+&nbsp;framework) (in billions of euros). The measures are primarily carried out in developing countries and emerging economies and are financed from German budget funds (including the gift equivalents of development loans since 2017).        

dns_indicator_intention: The Federal Government’s aim is to raise its contribution to international climate finance to 6&nbsp;billion euros<sup>1</sup> from public funds and grant elements of development loans by 2025, thereby trebling the target value for 2014, which was 2&nbsp;billion euros. In the decisions contained in the Addendum to the Paris Agreement, the industrialised countries reaffirmed their 2009&nbsp;commitment to collectively provide 100&nbsp;billion <abbr title="United States" tabindex="0">US</abbr>-dollar from public funds and from private sources mobilised by public funds, every year from 2020&nbsp;to 2025, for mitigation and adaptation to climate change in developing countries.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>Adjustment of the target year and target value from 4&nbsp;billion euros by 2020&nbsp;according to policy resolution 2022.</small>        

dns_political_intention: The decisions accompanying the Paris Climate Agreement reaffirmed the commitment made by industrialised countries in 2009&nbsp;to jointly provide <abbr title="United States Dollar" tabindex="0">USD</abbr> 100&nbsp;billion from public and publicly mobilised private sources for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries from 2020&nbsp;to 2025.        

political_target: Raise international climate finance to at least 6&nbsp;billion euro by 2025&nbsp;at the latest        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data for this indicator is derived from reporting carried out under the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> Regulation on a mechanism for monitoring greenhouse gases. The source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports in this context on climate finance from other federal ministries. In the case of bilateral climate finance, expenditure is calculated on the basis of funds allocated; in the case of multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, it is calculated on the basis of funds actually paid. The indicator also includes climate finance that is attributed to donors pro rata on the basis of their contributions to multilateral funds managed by development banks. As climate finance primarily benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development expenditure (see indicator 17.1&nbsp;“Official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income”).<br><br>In 2021, Germany committed or provided 5.34&nbsp;billion euros in public funds for international climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change. Compared with the previous year, when climate finance amounted to 5.09&nbsp;billion euros, this represents an increase of 4.9&nbsp;%. The target for 2025&nbsp;–&nbsp;to reach 6&nbsp;billion euros&nbsp;–&nbsp;will most likely be achieved if the development continues. The previous target&nbsp;–&nbsp;to reach 4&nbsp;billion euros by 2020&nbsp;–&nbsp;was already achieved in 2019&nbsp;at 4.34&nbsp;billion euros. In 2021, 36&nbsp;% of climate finance went to fund projects to reduce emissions, while 33&nbsp;% went towards adaptation to climate change. The remaining 30&nbsp;% was used to finance horizontal measures. As the horizontal measures serve both the reduction and adaptation efforts, the final split in 2021, as in previous years, shows more funds being used for emissions reduction (51&nbsp;%) than for adaptation (49&nbsp;%).<br><br>18&nbsp;% of climate finance, or 971&nbsp;million euros, was provided through multilateral channels in 2021. 268&nbsp;million euros of that can be attributed to Germany on the basis of the climate-related shares of Germany’s contributions to multilateral development banks, the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Germany provides the remaining 703&nbsp;million euros through multilateral institutions and contributions to international climate funds.<br><br>In addition to official climate finance from public funds, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (<abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>) and <abbr title="German Investment and Development Corporation" tabindex="0">DEG</abbr> (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans with funds from the market. These represent mobilised public climate finance and are not included in the indicator. In 2021, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to approximately 2.59&nbsp;billion euros, compared with 2.55&nbsp;billion euros the previous year. Here too, more funding went towards emissions reduction (58&nbsp;%) than adaptation (42&nbsp;%).</p>'

target_description: German payments to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change are to be increased to at least €6&nbsp;billion per year by 2025.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, the politically defined target value was reached ahead of schedule in 2022. Although the value fell below the target value again in 2023, the politically defined target value will be achieved in 2025&nbsp;if the development of the last six years is maintained, meaning that indicator 13.1.b is rated as "Sun" for 2023.
