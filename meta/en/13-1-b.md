national_indicator_available: International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the financing of measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), adapt to climate change and climate-relevant measures to preserve biodiversity and protect forests (projects for the conservation, sustainable use and reforestation of forests under the <abbr title="Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation" tabindex="0">REDD</abbr>+&nbsp;framework) (in billions of euros). The measures are primarily carried out in developing countries and emerging economies and are financed from German budget funds (including the gift equivalents of development loans since 2017).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The decisions accompanying the Paris Climate Agreement reaffirmed the commitment made by industrialised countries in 2009&nbsp;to jointly provide <abbr title="United States Dollar" tabindex="0">USD</abbr> 100&nbsp;billion from public and publicly mobilised private sources for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries from 2020&nbsp;to 2025.        

political_target: Raise international climate finance to at least 6&nbsp;billion euro by 2025&nbsp;at the latest        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #3f7e44; font-size: large">13.1.b International climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change</b><br><br>The indicator reflects Germany’s contribution to the financing of international climate-related measures. These include activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, and protecting biodiversity and forests. The measures are funded from the German federal budget and are primarily implemented in developing and emerging economies. Since 2017, so-called "grant equivalents" of development loans have also been included in the calculation. These are not actual payments but calculated values that represent the financial benefit compared to market-based conditions of concessional loans.<br><br>The data are provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (<abbr title="Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development" tabindex="0">BMZ</abbr>), which also compiles information on climate finance from other federal ministries. For bilateral climate finance, committed funds are taken into account, while for multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, actual disbursements are used. The indicator also includes the climate-related share of Germany’s contributions to multilateral funds at development banks.<br><br>The politically defined target is to provide at least 6&nbsp;billion euros annually for international climate finance starting in 2025, to support both emission reduction and adaptation measures. This target was already met in 2022, with 6.39&nbsp;billion euros committed — three years ahead of schedule. In 2023, however, the committed or allocated budgetary resources amounted to 5.66&nbsp;billion euros, representing an 11&nbsp;% decline and once again falling below the target.<br><br>The previous target for this indicator, which applied until 2020, aimed to increase payments to 4&nbsp;billion euros per year. That goal was achieved as early as 2019, with contributions totalling 4.34&nbsp;billion euros, and has been exceeded every year since.<br><br>In 2023, 57&nbsp;% of climate finance was allocated to greenhouse gas mitigation measures and 43&nbsp;% to adaptation efforts. Overall, projects were implemented in more than 80&nbsp;countries.<br><br>Around 79&nbsp;% of the climate finance (based on financial volume) was delivered through bilateral cooperation with partner countries in 2023, while 21&nbsp;% of the funds were channelled via multilateral institutions.<br><br>In addition to public climate finance from the federal budget, the German development bank <abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr> and the Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (<abbr title="German Investment and Development Corporation" tabindex="0">DEG</abbr>) also provide climate-related loans and financing from market-based resources. These so-called “mobilised public climate finance” contributions are not included in the indicator. In 2023, these mobilised funds amounted to approximately 3.81&nbsp;billion euros, up from 3.09&nbsp;billion euros in the previous year.</p>'

target_description: German payments to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change are to be increased to at least €6&nbsp;billion per year by 2025.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, the politically defined target value was reached ahead of schedule in 2022. Although the value fell below the target value again in 2023, the politically defined target value will be achieved in 2025&nbsp;if the development of the last six years is maintained, meaning that indicator 13.1.b is rated as "Sun" for 2023.
