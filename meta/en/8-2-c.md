#Metadata                   
national_indicator_available: Government debt                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the government debt as defined by the Maastricht Treaty as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) at current prices. The indicator therefore serves as a measure of government debt.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>                   

dns_indicator_intention: The European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact specifies a reference value of 60&nbsp;% as the maximum debt-to-GDP ratio. This also is the upper limit of the national target value of the indicator which is relevant for this report.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>                   

indicator_name: Government debt                   
target: Government debt - Decent work and economic growth

content_and_progress: The government debt is determined by the Bundesbank twice annually pursuant to the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty and based on calculations by the Federal Statistical Office. The GDP at current prices is determined by the Federal Statistical Office as part of the national accounts system and published as a preliminary value in January of the following year.<br><br>The debt-to-GDP ratio is influenced by the state of the public budgets and by economic development in general. The indicator compares the “debt” stock variable with the “gross domestic product” flow variable. According to the formula – assuming stable debt – the debt ratio falls faster the stronger GDP growth. In case of positive economic development, the debt-to- GDP ratio will even fall without any reduction in the overall public debt. <br><br>Furthermore, the indicator excludes implicit government debt, which refers to the government’s future payment obligations that are pledged but not yet due.<br><br>Since 2003, the debt-to-GDP ratio in Germany has been continuously above the Europe-wide harmonised and compulsory threshold. Following public budget consolidation efforts in the middle of the last decade, it fell to 63.7&nbsp;% in 2007, only to increase further to a high of 81.0&nbsp;% by 2010. This increase has to be seen in the light of the financial market and economic crisis. Overall, the government debt increased by 420 billion euros from 1,669 billion euros in 2008 to 2,089 billion euros in 2010.<br><br>In the subsequent years, the burdens imposed by the financial market and economic crisis were considerably reduced. The debt ratio fell to 63.9&nbsp;% in 2017. Central government (Federation) reduced its debt for the first time in 2015 by 23.9 billion euros to 1,373 billion euros. In 2017 the debt of central government amounted to 1,351 billion euros. The debts of state government (Länder) fell by 73.1 billion euros from their peak in 2012 to 611 billion euros in 2017. The debt owed by local government (municipalities) in Germany decreased slightly for the first time since 2007 to 148 billion euros (2017). Since 2010, the social security funds reduced their debt by 554 million euros to 792 million euros in 2017. In 2017, 64&nbsp;% of the overall debt was owed by central government (Federation), roughly 29&nbsp;% by state government (Länder) and roughly 7&nbsp;% by local government (municipalities).<br><br>In the national balance of assets, the government debt is balanced by its assets – both tangible and financial. The biggest asset owned by the government is its buildings and structures (roads, schools, public buildings). According to the national wealth accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office, fixed assets were valued (after amortisation) at 1,359 billion euros in 2016. The financial assets were valued at 1,149 billion euros (2016). Among them, securities represent the most highly valued asset.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>
