dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows internal expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and Development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) by industry, the state and universities in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) (as a percentage).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and Development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) is an important, if not the sole, determinant of the pace of innovation in an economy. The higher the expenditure, the greater the likelihood of a more dynamic development in productivity, stronger economic growth and improved competitiveness.        

political_target: At least 3.5&nbsp;per cent of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) per year by 2025

The surveys and calculations follow the methodological guidelines of the Frascati Manual issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr>), thereby ensuring international comparability.<br><br>In 2023, total <abbr title="Research and Development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany amounted to 132.0&nbsp;billion euros according to preliminary figures.
