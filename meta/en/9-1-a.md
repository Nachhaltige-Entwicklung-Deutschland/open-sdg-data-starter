national_indicator_available: Private and public expenditure on research and development                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the expenditure on research and development by businesses, general government and institutions of higher education in relation to gross domestic product (GDP).                   

dns_indicator_intention: Expenditure on research and development (R&D) is an important, although not the only determinant of an economy’s rate of innovation. The higher the expenditure, the higher the probability of more dynamic gains in productivity, the stronger economic growth and the more competitiveness is improved. The Federal Government has therefore set itself the goal of ensuring that expenditure on research and development increases to at least an annual 3.5&nbsp;% 1 of gross domestic product by 2025.

#Content                    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>Research and development are scientific activities and are defined as creative and systematic work to expand the level of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and the development of new applications based on the existing knowledge. The main criterion applied to differentiate between R&D and related activities is whether the activity involves an appreciable element of newness or further development.<br><br>The share of research and development expenditure in the gross domestic product (GDP) is determined annually by the Federal Statistical Office. Overall expenditure on research and development comprises expenditure by general government (including non-profit private research institutions), institutions of higher education, and businesses. The surveys and calculations adhere to the recommended methodologies of the Frascati Manual of the OECD on statistics about research and development, which also enable international comparisons.<br><br>Overall R&D expenditure in Germany in 2016 amounted to 92.2 billion euros, equivalent to 2.9&nbsp;% of GDP. Since 2000, the proportion in Germany has increased by about 0.5 percentage points. In the 1990s it initially fell, dropping to its lowest point in 1994/95 and not surpassing the 1991 level again until 2002. The original goal envisaged for 2010 – a share of 3&nbsp;% of R&D expenditure in GDP – was at no point reached. Following a change in the target, the 2016 indicator was 0.6 percentage points below the annual target of 3.5&nbsp;% of GDP by 2025. If the development of the last five years continues, it can be assumed that the target value will not be reached.<br><br>In international comparison, Germany is ahead of the USA with 2.7&nbsp;% (2016) and the EU-28 region with just 2.0&nbsp;%. On the other hand, some countries as for example Sweden (3.3&nbsp;%) or Japan (3.1&nbsp;%) are considerably ahead of Germany.<br><br>In 2016, businesses accounted for the by far largest share of R&D expenditure in Germany at around 68&nbsp;%, with 18&nbsp;% spent by institutions of higher education and a further 14&nbsp;% by both public and private non-profit research institutions. Staff employed in R&D comprised around 658,000 full-time equivalents, a figure that includes only the share of their working hours actually spent on R&D work. Some 63&nbsp;% of the staff work in businesses, 21&nbsp;% in institutions of higher education and 16&nbsp;% in public and private non-profit research institutions.
