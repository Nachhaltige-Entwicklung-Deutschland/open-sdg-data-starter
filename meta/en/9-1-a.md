dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows internal expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and Development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) by industry, the state and universities in relation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) (as a percentage).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Expenditure on research and development (<abbr title="Research and Development" tabindex="0">R&D</abbr>) is an important, if not the sole, determinant of the pace of innovation in an economy. The higher the expenditure, the greater the likelihood of a more dynamic development in productivity, stronger economic growth and improved competitiveness.        

political_target: At least 3.5% of gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>) per year by 2025

target_description: Private and public expenditures on research and development should amount to at least 3.5% of gross domestic product each year.<br><br>• According to the target formulation, the politically defined target value was again not achieved in 2023. However, since the six-year average development does not indicate any deterioration, indicator 9.1.a is assessed as <b>cloud</b> for 2023.
