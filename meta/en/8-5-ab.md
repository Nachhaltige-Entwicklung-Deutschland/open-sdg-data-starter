national_indicator_available: Employment rate                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators specify the proportion of persons in employment aged between 20 and 64 years (8.5.a) and aged between 60 and 64 years (8.5.b), measured in each case as a share of the total population of the same age group.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Due to demographic changes, there could be a shortage of professionals in Germany in the long run. At the same time, the social security system is threatened by an increasing shortage of funds. The available labour force potential must therefore be more effectively utilised in the future. The employment rate, that is, the share of persons in employment in the working-age population (20 to 64 years of age) should be increased to 78&nbsp;% by 2030. In addition, the goal of the Federal Government is to achieve an employment rate of 60&nbsp;% among older people (60 to 64 years of age) by 2030.

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data source for the indicators is the EU labour force survey, which is integrated into the microcensus in Germany. The labour force survey is conducted by the Federal Statistical Office on an infra-annual basis. The European statistical office Eurostat summarises the data to form quarterly results and then consolidates them to create annual average values. It covers the population living in private households, but does not include people living in collective accommodation. The economically active population covered by the labour force survey consists of persons aged 15 and over who performed an activity for remuneration for at least one hour during the reference week or who worked as unpaid family workers. Also included are persons who temporarily did not work because they were absent, for example due to holidays or illness.<br><br>Since reference year 2005, annual averages have been used for the employment rates. In previous years, the calculations were based on a fixed reference week per year. From 2011 onwards, the questionnaire was revised in order to improve the mapping of employment, and the extrapolation factor was adjusted using the population estimate based on the 2011 Census. Starting with reference year 2016, the sampling frame was updated on the basis of the 2011 Census. Due to the methodological changes, comparing the results over time is only possible to a limited extent.<br><br>The total employment rate (20 to 64-year-olds) rose by 10.5 percentage points from 68.7&nbsp;% in 2000 to 79.2&nbsp;% in 2017. Thus, the target value of 78.0&nbsp;% for 2030 has already been achieved.<br><br>The employment rate among the older age groups (60 to 64-year-olds) rose by 38.8 percentage points from 19.6&nbsp;% in 2000 to 58.4&nbsp;% in 2017. The rate for men in this age group more than doubled by 36.5 percentage points to 63.7&nbsp;%. The rate for women even quadrupled in value by 41.2 percentage points to 53.3&nbsp;%. If the average annual trend continues, the goal of reaching 60&nbsp;% in 2030 will be achieved.<br><br>The total employment rates of women and men have developed in the same direction since 2000, but to different degrees. The rate for men aged 20 to 64 in the period under review rose by 6.6 percentage points to 83.1&nbsp;%, whereas in the case of women it rose by 14.5 percentage points to 75.2&nbsp;%, that is, much more strongly albeit from a lower level. In evaluating the increase in the employment rate of women, it must be taken into consideration that this was accompanied by a clear increase in part-time employment (+2.8&nbsp;million), while the number of women in full-time employment increased by just 0.45&nbsp;million.<br><br>If the employment rate is broken down into age groups, different trends can be identified. Among 20 to 24-year-olds, the rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 64.6&nbsp;% between 2000 and 2017. The lower level compared to 25 to 59-year-olds is also related to the average duration of education at school and university, which postpones entry into working life. Among 25 to 59-year-olds, however, an increase of the employment rate to 83.6&nbsp;% in 2017 (+7.4 percentage points compared with 2000) can be observed.
