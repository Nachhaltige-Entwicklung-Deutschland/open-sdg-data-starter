#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Imports from least developed countries    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the imports from the least developed countries (LDCs) as a proportion of all imports to Germany, measured in euros.    

dns_indicator_intention: To promote global sustainable development, it is important to improve trading opportunities of developing and emerging countries. Developing and emerging countries need an open and fair trading system that will allow them to offer raw materials as well as processed products on the world market. The Federal Government has therefore set itself the target of doubling the proportion of imports from LDCs between the years 2014 and 2030.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021</i><br><br>Information about imports to Germany is compiled from the foreign trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office. In this case, the type of the imported goods is also recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, their value and weight. The service sector is excluded from foreign trade statistics.<br><br><br><br>The various countries are classified as LDCs based on the list of recipients of official development assistance kept by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The classifications valid in the respective year according to the OECD-DAC are used for this indicator. If the status of a country changes, this will impact the indicator even if the value of imports from this country remains unchanged. However, changes in the status of countries are scarcely relevant to the development of the indicator in the period shown.<br><br><br><br>Various factors can influence the value and development of the indicator. These can include technology transfers or changes in customs duties, but also the political stability of a country or the infrastructure. The additional provision of figures for processed products should address, at least to some extent, the question as to whether Germany mainly uses the LDCs as sources of basic materials for industrial products or whether the LDCs themselves are able to gain benefits from the value added by participating in the production process.<br><br><br><br>Due to reimports, duplicate counting in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be excluded. The fact that the imports from LDCs are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. This means that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from LDCs, but also on the value of all imports.<br><br><br><br>In addition to Germany’s overall imports from LDCs, the graph also shows the share of processed products. This includes all goods that are not classified as “raw materials” in the classification by product group of the food and industrial economy (EGW). Accordingly, unprocessed or barely processed goods extracted from nature, such as crude oil, ores, logs or plant-based textile fibres, are not included. In contrast, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br><br><br>Imports from LDCs as a proportion of all imports to Germany was 0.93&nbsp;% or 9.6 billion euros in 2017 (provisional results). This is an increase of more than 113&nbsp;% compared with 2002, when the share was just 0.44&nbsp;%. However, the positive development has been observed only since 2008. The share of imports of processed products from LDCs increased even more sharply between 2002 and 2017 (+146&nbsp;%). It has now reached 0.88% of total imports to Germany (2002: 0.36&nbsp;%), which equates to a value of around 9.1 billion euros. If the increase of the last five years continues, it can be assumed that the target will be reached.<br><br><br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that almost three quarters of imports from LDCs in 2017 came from Bangladesh (55.51&nbsp;%) and Cambodia (16.04&nbsp;%). Considering not only the LDCs but all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2017 was 21.86&nbsp;%, and the share of processed products was 20.09&nbsp;% (from 13.67&nbsp;% and 12.17&nbsp;% in 2002, respectively). Consequently, the imports from LDCs both in terms of all goods as well as processed goods accounted for a rather small share of imports from developing and emerging countries. As is shown above, their share of total imports has however increased more strongly over time. China plays the most important role among all developing and emerging countries. Imports from China alone as a proportion of all German imports was 9.74&nbsp;%, and 9.7&nbsp;% for processed goods. This makes China the leading country in terms of imports to Germany."
