national_indicator_available: Women in management positions in business and in the federal civil service        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator 5.1.b shows the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies. Indicator 5.1.c shows the percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: Indicator 5.1.b shows the proportion of women on the supervisory boards of listed companies and companies with parity co-determination (in per cent). Indicator 5.1.c shows the proportion of women in management positions in the federal public sector.        

dns_indicator_intention: Women are as highly qualified as men, yet they are under-represented in management positions in German business, particularly at senior management level. The same applies to the percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service. For this reason, the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies is to be increased to 30&nbsp;% by 2030. Under the bill for a Second Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act, which became effective on 21&nbsp;August 2021, equal representation of women and men in management positions in the civil service is to be achieved by 2025.        

dns_political_intention: Women are just as qualified as men and yet are underrepresented in management positions in the German economy, especially in top management. The same applies to the proportion of women in management positions in the federal civil service. The increase in the proportion of women in management positions is an indicator of progress towards equality.

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br><b><i>Percentage of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies</i></b><br><br><br><br>This indicator measures the proportion of women on the supervisory boards of listed companies and joint-stock companies with more than 2,000&nbsp;employees as well as European Companies (<abbr title="Societas Europaea" tabindex="0">SE</abbr>) and listed companies that are subject to equal co-determination. The data is based on publications of the results of elections at general meetings of shareholders of listed and fully co-determined companies, which are evaluated by the association “Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte” (<abbr title="Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte" tabindex="0">FidAR</abbr>) and published in the form of a Women on Board Index (<abbr title="Women on Board" tabindex="0">WOB</abbr>-Index).<br><br>In January 2022, the average proportion of women on the supervisory boards of these companies was 35.6&nbsp;% (January 2015: 21.3&nbsp;%). This means that the target share of 30&nbsp;% was already reached in 2018&nbsp;–&nbsp;twelve years before the deadline set in the German strategy for sustainable development. However, the share in 2022&nbsp;slightly decreased for the first time since 2015.<br><br>Provided that the companies complied with the law, this increase was to be expected as the “Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions” since 2016&nbsp;requires at least 30&nbsp;% of the supervisory board positions to be filled by women in all newly elected supervisory boards of the above-mentioned companies.<br><br>With regard to the results, it should also be noted that the majority of companies in Germany and most of the management positions in the economy are excluded by the underlying definition. On the one hand, the group of reporting entities currently comprises 101&nbsp;companies according to the definition. On the other hand, the roughly 1,600&nbsp;supervisory board positions considered by <abbr title="Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte" tabindex="0">FidAR</abbr> to date represent only a small portion of management positions in the economy with its 882,000&nbsp;managers in 2018&nbsp;according to the structure of earnings survey (more recent data was not available at the time of going to press). These numbers illustrate that only part of the management positions in a company are considered when the coverage is limited to the supervisory bodies.<br><br>According to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (<abbr title="International Standard Classification of Occupations" tabindex="0">ISCO</abbr>), managers are all persons who plan, control, coordinate and evaluate the overall activities of companies, governments and other organisations or internal organisational units and who review and evaluate guidelines, laws, rules and regulations. This definition includes the activities of supervisory boards. When the <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Occupations" tabindex="0">ISCO</abbr> classification is applied, 22&nbsp;% of the 882,000&nbsp;management positions in the economy (all companies with more than one employee) were filled by women in 2018. This figure is reached by considering all businesses with at least one employee for whom compulsory social insurance contributions are payable, excluding entities in sector O “Public administration and defence; compulsory social security” and parts of sector P “Education”. Compared with 2014, the year of the previous structure of earnings survey, this represents an increase of 1.2&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br><br><br><b><i>Percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service</i></b><br><br><br><br>The data basis for this indicator comprises the internal gender equality statistics collected by all offices of the federal government pursuant to the Federal Gender Equality Act. Since 2015, these statistics have been compiled every second year, updated to 30&nbsp;June of the reporting year, by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. For improved transparency, the indicator will receive biannual data from extended monitoring by the measure IX 1.b by the German strategy for sustainable development and the second managements position act (<abbr title="Führungspositionen-Gesetz" tabindex="0">FüPoG</abbr> II) provided by subordinated departments of the direct federal administration regarding the number of women and men in management positions. The indicator is focused on the employees in management positionsin all departments of the Federal Government. Their number includes all persons employed on a full-time or part-time basis as well as those who have been given leave of absence on grounds of family or care responsibilities or have been entirely released from their normal duties. The departments of the federal civil service encompass the supreme federal authorities, the subordinate federal authorities and courts and the corporations, agencies and foundations established under federal public law.<br><br>The concept of management positions that is used in the federal gender equality statistics differs from the aforementioned <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Occupations" tabindex="0">ISCO</abbr> definition. There is therefore only limited scope for comparisons between the different statistics.<br><br>According to <abbr title="Paragraph" tabindex="0">§</abbr> 3&nbsp;of the gender equality statistics regulation (GleiStatV), managers have hitherto comprised those persons who have command and leadership duties in departments of the civil service. In the supreme federal authorities these are predominantly employees of the higher service (from head of section to State Secretary). Further, other departments of the central government are authorized to transfer leadership positions to employees in higher intermediate or intermediate services. In order to ensure a certain degree of consistency and to enable comparability of the data, only employees with supervisory and management duties in the higher service are recorded in the supreme federal authorities, irrespective of whether employees in the higher intermediate or intermediate services also perform such duties in these departments.<br><br>In 2021, the proportion of women in management positions in the federal civil service was about 39.6&nbsp;% (2000: 19.5&nbsp;%). Thus, the proportion of women has doubled in size since 2000. If the trend of the last five years were maintained, the target of virtual numerical equality in management positions in the federal civil service by 2025&nbsp;would be narrowly missed.</p>'

target_description: The proportion of women on supervisory boards of listed companies and companies with parity co-determination (5.1.b) is to be increased to at least 40&nbsp;per cent by 2030&nbsp;and the proportion of women in management positions in the federal public sector (5.1.c) to at least 45&nbsp;per cent by 2025.<br>Based on the target formulation, the politically defined target for indicator 5.1.b will already be met by 2026&nbsp;if the trend of the last six years continues, meaning that the indicator for 2024&nbsp;is rated as "Sun".<br>For indicator 5.1.c, no concrete numerical value can be derived from the politically defined target formulation, so that this formulation is interpreted as an interval of ± 5&nbsp;percentage points around the 50&nbsp;per cent parity. The minimum target value to be achieved is therefore 45&nbsp;per cent. This value has already been achieved ahead of schedule in 2023, meaning that indicator 5.1.c is rated as "Sun" for 2024.
