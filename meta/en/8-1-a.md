national_indicator_available: Raw material input productivity                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator of raw material input productivity compares the value of all goods provided for final use (in euros, price-adjusted) relative to the mass of the raw materials used domestically and abroad for their production (in tonnes). Final use covers domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports. The denominator of the indicator takes into account abiotic and biotic raw materials from the environment as well as plant materials produced by farming and forestry.                   

dns_indicator_intention: The extraction of raw materials is always associated with impairments to the natural environment. Due to the growing demand for raw materials, worldwide raw material deposits are increasingly being developed in areas that are particularly sensitive to human influences. For this reason, the Federal Government set the goal of continuing to increase raw material input productivity already in 2016 in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II. From 2000 to 2010, raw material input productivity was already increasing by an annual average of around 1.6&nbsp;%. This positive trend should be continued up to 2030.

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>To calculate this indicator, it is necessary to determine the mass of all raw materials required to produce the imports. The calculation of this variable, referred to as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br>Due to the monetary and physical inclusion of imports, the indicator takes into account the value added and raw material use across the entire production chain both inside and outside of Germany. In this way, the economic interdependence with foreign countries is also taken into account comprehensively. The raw material use mapped in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also exports. It should therefore not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br>The indicator includes not only the raw materials that were considered to be non-renewable, that is, mineral raw materials and fossile fuels, but also plant-based products from farming and forestry activities. This means that double counting occurs to a limited degree. For example, both the mass of an agricultural product at harvest time as well as that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br>Based on preliminary results, the value of the indicator increased by 26&nbsp;% from 2000 to 2014. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator: the value of the final use (domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports) increased by 31&nbsp;% during the reference period. The removal of domestic raw materials fell moderately between 2000 and 2014; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, causing a slight increase of 4&nbsp;% in the indicator’s denominator.<br><br>Domestically extracted raw materials as well as imports are also being exported (again) to an increasing degree. Consequently, the indicator’s denominator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany, but reflects generally more intensive links between the German economy and the outside world.<br><br>The year 2009 should be considered an outlier due to the exceptional economic situation in the European financial market and economic crisis . The values for the years 2010 to 2014 continued the path of development that prevailed up to 2008. From 2013 to 2014, the value of the indicator grew by 3&nbsp;% and thus followed the positive trend from the preceding years."
