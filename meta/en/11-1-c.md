#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Density of settlements    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of inhabitants per square kilometre of settlement and transport area.    

dns_indicator_intention: The “density of settlements” indicator provides information on the efficient use of the settlement area. The goal of the Federal Government is to counteract the reduction in the density of settlements by means of space-saving measures in new construction projects and inner-urban development, such as the reduction in housing and commercial vacancies, as well as re-densification and an increase in building density    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.    

indicator_name: Density of settlements    
section: Land use    
postulate: Sustainable use of land    

#Content    
content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021</i><br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. With regard to population data, the 2011 census caused a jump in the time series, which is why only the comparisons up to 2010 and from 2011 onwards can be usefully interpreted. <br><br><br><br>Regarding the area survey by type of actual use, a methodological change in the survey basis took place in 2016, so that the comparability of the data with previous years is limited from 2016 onwards. In order to be able to compare the data, the respective values were recalculated on the basis of the 2011 Census and the change in the area survey in 2016.<br><br><br><br>The distinction between “rural” and “non-rural” is based on a type classification of the Thünen Institute. This classification allocates a degree of “ruralness” to rural districts and towns not attached to an administrative district – based on spatial characteristics such as “density of settlements”, “share of agricultural and forestry area” and “location relative to the centres”.<br><br><br><br>In contrast to population density, the concept of the density of settlements refers to the ratio of inhabitants solely to the settlement and transport area. In addition to residential building areas, the settlement area includes areas with special functional character (e.g. hospitals and schools), industrial and commercial areas and mixed-use areas as well as open areas (parks, green spaces, garden land). Consequently, changes not only in population numbers, but also in the residential building area, such as an internal densification of the transport or commercial area, lead to a change in the density of settlements.<br><br><br><br>The density of settlements differs substantially between rural and non-rural regions: one square kilometre of settlement and transport area accommodates around 3,330 people on average in non-rural district types, compared with around 1,216 people in rural district types (as in 2016). In this context, the residential building area in cities is frequently a much more densely built-up area as well as has many more multiple-floor buildings than rural regions, where more scattered development incorporating larger, unsealed areas such as domestic gardens is prevalent.<br><br><br><br>From 2000 until the end of 2010, there was a steady decline in the density of settlements in both rural and non-rural regions. In this context, the non-rural regions experienced a slightly lower absolute decrease than the rural regions. Viewed in relative terms, the 11&nbsp;% decline in rural regions, due to their considerably lower density of settlements, was however substantially larger than that of 4&nbsp;% in non-rural regions.<br><br><br><br>Since 2012, differences have been observed between the development in rural and non-rural regions. In non-rural regions, the density of settlements rose steadily from 3,251 inhabitants per square kilometre (2012) to 3,330 (2016). In rural regions, the decrease in the density of settlements continued at a moderate pace until 2014 (1,210 inhabitants/km²). In 2015, however, there was an increase (1,218 inhabitants/km²), presumably due to the population growth resulting from the influx of refugees, which slowed in 2016 (1,216 inhabitants/km²).<br><br><br><br>Considering the development of the number of inhabitants and the settlement and transport area separately, considerable differences between rural and non-rural regions can be observed. Between 2000 and 2015, the volume of the settlement and transport area in both rural and non-rural regions increased, although to different extents of 13&nbsp;% and 8&nbsp;% respectively. Following the slight increase in the population of rural regions at the start of the millennium, it decreased by around 2.3&nbsp;% until 2010 and then increased again slightly by 1&nbsp;% until 2016. In the non-rural regions, however, the population grew between 2000 and 2010 (by about 1.7&nbsp;%) and between 2011 and 2016 (by 4.4&nbsp;%). The effects of the development of additional settlement and transport area were therefore amplified in rural regions by the declining population numbers."
