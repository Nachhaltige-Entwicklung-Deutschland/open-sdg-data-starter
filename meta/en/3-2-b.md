#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Share of the population with excessive exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> in Germany    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of persons who are exposed at their place of residence to an annual average of more than 20 micrograms (μg) of PM<sub>10</sub> particulate matter (dust particles with a diameter less than 10 μm) per cubic metre (m³) of air (only background pollution, without local sources)    

dns_indicator_intention: The inhalation of particulate matter can lead for instance to respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer) and cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart attack). To better protect their health, by the year 2030 it should consequently be achieved that nobody will be exposed to an annual mean of more than 20 micrograms (μg) of particulate matter PM<sub>10</sub> per cubic metre of air at their place of residence (guideline value of the World Health Organization).    

indicator_name: Share of the population with excessive exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> in Germany

postulate: Keeping the environment healthy    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) contained in the air is recorded at more than 370 air measurement stations in both metropolitan and rural regions of Germany. However, the computation of this indicator takes account only of those measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particulate matter emissions e.g. from transport, as these map only elevated peak values (“hot spots”) rather than general pollution levels. This recorded data which is called background pollution is combined with geographical information to determine the number of persons who are exposed to an average annual particulate matter pollution of more than 20 μg per m³ of air at their place of residence. Since the modelled calculation is based only on measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particular matter emissions from local sources, it may well be assumed that the indicator underestimates the level of pollution.<br><br><br><br>Rather than indicating nationwide compliance with the guideline value, the indicator merely shows that the value is not exceeded at the population’s places of residence. Neither does it give any indication of the exposure level of the population in total nor its variation in the course of the year. In addition, this indicator makes no provision for the separate analysis of pollution caused by finer particulate matter particles (PM<sub>2,5</sub> and PM<sub>0,1</sub>).<br><br><br><br>Particulate matter is mainly generated during the combustion processes of fossil fuels such as heating, in industrial plants or road traffic. Besides these primary sources, particulate matter can also be a secondary product of the chemical reaction of air pollutants, e.g. from agriculture.<br><br><br><br>The last few years have seen a significant reduction in particulate matter pollution caused by PM<sub>10</sub>. While in 2007 the average pollution exposure of the population was still 20.7 μg per m³ of air, in 2015 it was just 16.5 μg per m³. During the same period, the number of people exposed to an annual average of more than 20 μg PM<sub>10</sub> per m³ of air at their place of residence has also fallen considerably – from around 50 million people in 2007 to only around 4 million people in 2015. Part of the sharp decline between 2014 and 2015 is presumably due to the fact that there were exceptionally few periods of air stagnation in 2015.<br><br><br><br>If the average development of the past few years continues, it is likely that the achieved target of exposing the population nationwide to a background particulate matter pollution of less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter of air on an annual average can be sustained.
