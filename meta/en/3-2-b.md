dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the proportion of people (in per cent) who were exposed to more than 10&nbsp;micrograms (<abbr title="Micrograms" tabindex="0">µg</abbr>) of particulate matter <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> (dust particles with a diameter of less than 2.5&nbsp;micrometres) per cubic metre (<abbr title="Cubic metre" tabindex="0">m³</abbr>) of air at their place of residence on an annual average (background pollution only, excluding local sources).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Long-term human exposure to particulate matter can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as an increased risk of type 2&nbsp;diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to better protect health, the aim is therefore to ensure that no person in Germany is exposed to an annual average concentration of particulate matter (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>) of more than 10&nbsp;micrograms (<abbr title="Micrograms" tabindex="0">µg</abbr>) per cubic metre (<abbr title="Cubic metre" tabindex="0">m³</abbr>) of air at their place of residence by 2030. The target value of 10&nbsp;<abbr title="Micrograms per cubic metre" tabindex="0">µg/m³</abbr> corresponds to intermediate target 4&nbsp;from the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (<abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>) in the Air Quality Guidelines. In addition, this value was defined in the European Union's updated Air Quality Directive as a legal limit value to be complied with from 2030. The indicator enables continuous monitoring of development trends with regard to target achievement.        

political_target: Fall in the share of the population with an annual mean <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> exposure of more than 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre (equivalent to the level of the new <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> limit value for <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> from 2030) to 0&nbsp;per cent by 2030

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #4c9f38; font-size: large">3.2.b Share of the population with excessive exposure to fine particulate matter (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>)</b><br><br>The indicator reflects the proportion of the population that, on average over the course of a year, is exposed at their place of residence to fine particulate matter (PM) concentrations exceeding 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air. Fine particulate matter consists of airborne particles that can be inhaled and, depending on their size, may penetrate deep into the lungs or even enter the bloodstream. Until 2021, the indicator was based on particles with a diameter of up to 10&nbsp;micrometres (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₁₀</abbr>). With the revision of the German Sustainable Development Strategy in 2025, the indicator was adjusted to focus on smaller particles with a diameter of up to 2.5&nbsp;micrometres (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>), as these are considered particularly harmful to health.<br><br>The German government’s goal is that by 2030&nbsp;at the latest, no one will be exposed at their place of residence to an annual average <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> concentration exceeding 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre. This target corresponds to Interim Target 4&nbsp;of the 2021&nbsp;Air Quality Guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>). However, the <abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>’s recommended guideline value for <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> is just 5&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre annually.<br><br>Particulate matter can originate directly from sources such as industrial processes for energy and heat generation, agriculture, road traffic, and heating with solid fuels&nbsp;–&nbsp;for instance, wood-burning stoves and fireplaces. In addition, particulate matter can also form indirectly through secondary particle formation. This occurs when gaseous precursor substances&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as sulphur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, or hydrocarbons&nbsp;–&nbsp;undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to create fine particles.<br><br><abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> exposure levels are determined using a combination of modelling and measurement data provided by the German Environment Agency (<abbr title="Federal Environment Agency" tabindex="0">UBA</abbr>) and the federal states. The indicator relies solely on data from background monitoring stations in both urban and rural areas that are not directly influenced by local emission sources such as traffic or industrial facilities. This ensures that the indicator reflects regional background concentrations rather than being skewed by localised pollution “hot spots”.<br><br>The indicator does not measure the nationwide compliance with the <abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr> guideline value, but only compliance at residential locations away from major emission sources. It also does not provide information on the precise level of exposure for the entire population or on seasonal fluctuations. Since localised pollution hot spots are not accounted for in the modelling, it can be assumed that the actual number of people exposed to <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> concentrations above 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre is higher than the indicator suggests.<br><br>In 2010, the entire population was exposed to <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> concentrations above the 10-microgram threshold. In the years that followed, this share decreased significantly: by 2021, 28.2&nbsp;% of the population was affected, compared to only 15.0&nbsp;% the year before. However, if the <abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr> guideline value of 5&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre were used as the benchmark, nearly the entire population would still be considered affected.<br><br>Alongside the share of the population exposed to elevated concentrations, the average <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> pollution level has also dropped significantly since 2010. In 2021, the population-weighted annual average was 9.3&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre&nbsp;–&nbsp;a reduction of approximately 42&nbsp;% compared to 2010, when the average was 15.9&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre.</p>'
