dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of people (in %) who were exposed to more than 10&nbsp;micrograms (<abbr title="Micrograms" tabindex="0">µg</abbr>) of particulate matter <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> (dust particles with a diameter of less than 2.5&nbsp;micrometres) per cubic metre (<abbr title="Cubic metre" tabindex="0">m³</abbr>) of air at their place of residence on an annual average (background pollution only, excluding local sources).        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Long-term human exposure to particulate matter can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as an increased risk of type 2&nbsp;diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to better protect health, the aim is therefore to ensure that no person in Germany is exposed to an annual average concentration of particulate matter (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>) of more than 10&nbsp;micrograms (<abbr title="Micrograms" tabindex="0">µg</abbr>) per cubic metre (<abbr title="Cubic metre" tabindex="0">m³</abbr>) of air at their place of residence by 2030. The target value of 10&nbsp;<abbr title="Micrograms per cubic metre" tabindex="0">µg/m³</abbr> corresponds to intermediate target 4&nbsp;from the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (<abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>) in the Air Quality Guidelines. In addition, this value was defined in the European Union's updated Air Quality Directive as a legal limit value to be complied with from 2030. The indicator enables continuous monitoring of development trends with regard to target achievement.        

political_target: Fall in the share of the population with an annual mean <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> exposure of more than 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre (equivalent to the level of the new <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> limit value for <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> from 2030) to 0% by 2030

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #4c9f38; font-size: large">3.2.b Share of the population with excessive exposure to fine particulate matter (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>)</b><br><br>The indicator measures the proportion of the population whose place of residence is, on an annual average, exposed to fine particulate matter (PM) concentrations exceeding 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air. Fine particulate matter consists of airborne particles that can be inhaled and&nbsp;–&nbsp;depending on their size&nbsp;–&nbsp;penetrate deep into the lungs or even enter the bloodstream. Until 2021, the indicator referred to particles with a diameter of no more than 10&nbsp;micrometres (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₁₀</abbr>). With the revision of the German Sustainable Development Strategy 2025, the focus shifted to smaller particles of up to 2.5&nbsp;micrometres in diameter (<abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr>), as these are considered particularly relevant in terms of adverse health impacts.<br><br>The politically defined target stipulates that, by 2030&nbsp;at the latest, no one should be exposed at their place of residence to <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> concentrations exceeding 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air on an annual mean basis. This threshold corresponds to interim target 4&nbsp;of the air quality guidelines published by the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>) in 2021. However, the <abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr>’s recommended limit value for <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> is lower, at 5&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre annual mean.<br><br><abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> originates partly from primary emissions&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, from industrial processes for energy and heat generation, agriculture, road transport, and residential heating using solid fuels such as wood stoves or fireplaces. It can also form indirectly through so-called secondary particle formation: this occurs when fine particulate matter develops as a result of chemical reactions involving gaseous precursors such as sulphur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, or hydrocarbons.<br><br><abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> exposure levels are determined using a combination of modelling outputs and measurement data provided by the German Environment Agency (<abbr title="German Environment Agency" tabindex="0">UBA</abbr>) and the Länder. For the purposes of this indicator, only data from background monitoring stations in urban and rural areas are included&nbsp;–&nbsp;stations not directly influenced by local emission sources such as traffic or industrial facilities. This ensures a representative depiction of large-scale exposure patterns without distortion from localised "hot spots" of pollution.<br><br>The indicator does not represent full spatial compliance with the limit value; rather, it reflects residential locations away from significant emission sources. It therefore does not quantify the absolute exposure level of the entire population or capture seasonal variations. Since localised high-exposure areas are not incorporated into the model, the actual number of individuals with <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> exposure above 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre is likely to be higher than the indicator suggests.<br><br>In 2010, the entire population was exposed to <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> levels exceeding the threshold of 10&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre. In the following years, this share decreased markedly: by 2021, only 28.2% of the population was affected, compared with 15.0% in the previous year. If, however, the <abbr title="World Health Organization" tabindex="0">WHO</abbr> guideline value of 5&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre were applied as the reference, almost the entire population would still be considered exposed. In addition to the decline in the share of the population with elevated exposure, the population-weighted annual mean <abbr title="Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)" tabindex="0">PM₂.₅</abbr> concentration has also fallen significantly since 2010. In 2021, the population-weighted mean was 9.3&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre&nbsp;–&nbsp;representing a reduction of approximately 42% compared with 2010&nbsp;(15.9&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre).</p>'
