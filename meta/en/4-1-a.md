national_indicator_available: Early school leavers (18 to 24-year-olds leaving school without graduation)    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the 18 to 24-year-olds as a proportion of all people in the same age group who currently do not attend any school or an institution of higher education, who are not attending any continuing education/training programmes and who have not completed upper secondary education (ISCED level 3 - university entrance qualification or completed course of vocational training).    

dns_indicator_intention: The federal educational system and the dual system of vocational training are the cornerstones of future-orientated qualifications for young people in Germany. Failure to complete school or vocational training poses a risk of poverty and places a strain on the social welfare systems. In line with the “Europe 2020” strategy of the European Union, the German Government has therefore set itself the target of reducing the proportion of early school leavers among all persons in the same age group to below 10&nbsp;% by 2020.

postulate: Continuously improving education and vocational training    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The term “early school leavers” does not refer to the young “high achievers”, who obtain a school leaving certificate before the regular period of schooling ends. Nor should the term be confused with school drop-outs. On the contrary, it refers to people between 18 and 24 years of age who neither have obtained a higher education entrance qualification such as “Abitur” or “Fachhochschulreife” (for universities in general or universities of applied sciences), nor have completed vocational training and who are not attending initial and continuing education/ training programmes. This means that even those young people who, for example, have successfully completed “Hauptschule” or “Realschule” (lower secondary education, ISCED level 2) but are no longer participating in the education process are also counted as early school leavers. Moreover, it is not possible to conclude what type of educational institution they last attended and at what time.<br><br><br><br>The information originates from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1&nbsp;% of the population. The annual school statistics, which is a coordinated Länder statistics, provides supplementary information also published by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, according to provisional results, the indicator value was 10.1&nbsp;%, i.e. there were a total of 614,000 young people without completed upper secondary education who were not or no longer undergoing (vocational) training or continuing education. The 2020 target has not yet been achieved.<br><br><br><br>Between 1999 and 2005, the gender-specific indicator values deviated from the total values to varying degrees and in different directions. Since 2006, there have been fewer women than men leaving school early without a certificate of completion. For instance, the figures were 9.0&nbsp;% for women and 11.1&nbsp;% for men in 2017.<br><br><br><br>According to school statistics, a total of around 52,685 young people (6.6&nbsp;% of the resident population of the same age) left school without a “Hauptschule” certificate in 2016. Compared with 1999, this is a decline of somewhat more than a third. Here, too, the share of young women continues to be considerably lower (4.8&nbsp;%) than that of young men (8.6&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>Among school leavers with a school certificate, 16.9&nbsp;% (134,389) of the resident population of the same age hold a secondary general school certificate, 44.8&nbsp;% (356,812) a school leaving certificate after year 10, 32.5&nbsp;% (287,298) a general university entrance qualification and 0.1&nbsp;% (628) an entrance qualification for universities of applied sciences – all data referring to 2017. Since 1999, two types of certificates have seen particularly large changes over the course of time. Thus, the share of people with a secondary general school certificate fell by 9.2 percentage points, while the share of people with university entrance qualification rose by 7.8 percentage points (both as a proportion of the population of the same age).<br><br><br><br>Another indicator that relates to this subject matter is 10.1 “Foreign school graduates”.

data_footnote: The comparability of the results of the Microcensus from 2016 onwards with previous years is limited by methodological effects that can be traced back to the Microcensus 2016 (including the change of the sample basis with the 2011 census). A further effect influencing the results in 2016 is associated with the unusually high level of immigration, especially by persons seeking protection. Many of these immigrants are in the 15-24 age group. These persons are included in the population data and, where applicable, in educational programs in the transition zone (ISCED 244 or ISCED 254), predominantly for learning German.
