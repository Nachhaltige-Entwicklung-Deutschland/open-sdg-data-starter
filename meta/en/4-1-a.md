national_indicator_available: Early leavers from education and training        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds in the same age group (in per cent) who have neither a higher education entrance qualification, such as the Abitur or Fachhochschulreife, nor completed vocational training and who are not currently participating in education and training measures.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The state education system and the dual system of vocational training are the cornerstones of future-oriented qualifications for young people in Germany. A lack of school and vocational qualifications means an increased risk of poverty and a resulting greater burden on the social security system.        

political_target: Reduce the proportion to 9.5&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value        

data_state: 01.08.2024        

indicator_name: Early leavers from education and training        
section: Education

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #c5192d; font-size: large">4.1.a Early leavers from education and training</b><br><br>The term "early leavers from education and training" does not refer to particularly high-achieving young people, so-called "high flyers", who complete their schooling early with a qualification, nor is it synonymous with "school dropouts". Rather, it encompasses young people aged 18&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;who neither hold a higher education entrance qualification&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as the Abitur or Fachhochschulreife&nbsp;–&nbsp;nor have completed vocational training, and who are currently not participating in any form of education or training. This group also includes individuals who have obtained a lower secondary school qualification (Erster Schulabschluss, roughly equivalent to a general school-leaving certificate) or an intermediate school-leaving qualification (Realschulabschluss), provided they are no longer part of the education system.<br><br>The data basis for this indicator is the Mikrozensus, an annual sample survey that captures around 1&nbsp;% of the population in Germany. Due to a comprehensive methodological redesign in 2020, however, results from this reporting year onwards are only partially comparable with those from previous years.<br><br>This indicator does not provide information on the type of educational institution most recently attended or the timing of attendance. Supplementary insights can be drawn from the school statistics&nbsp;–&nbsp;a coordinated statistical compilation by the Länder, published by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>In 2023, according to provisional data, the share of early leavers from education and training among all persons in the same age group stood at 13.1&nbsp;%&nbsp;–&nbsp;an increase of 0.3&nbsp;percentage points compared to the previous year. This corresponds to approximately 799,000&nbsp;young people aged 18&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;without an upper secondary qualification who were not (or no longer) engaged in education or training. By 2014, this indicator had fallen to 9.5&nbsp;%, thereby already meeting the politically defined target for the year 2030. Since then, however, the trend has reversed and is moving contrary to the desired direction.<br><br>Between 1999&nbsp;and 2005, there were no systematic differences between the sexes. Since 2006, however, the proportion has consistently been lower for women than for men. In 2023, the rate was 10.8&nbsp;% for women and 15.3&nbsp;% for men.<br><br>According to the school statistics, a total of 55,708&nbsp;young people left school in 2023&nbsp;without obtaining a Erster Schulabschluss&nbsp;–&nbsp;equivalent to 7.2&nbsp;% of the population of the same age group. Here, too, a clear gender-specific difference is evident: the proportion of young women was 5.9&nbsp;%, compared to 8.4&nbsp;% among young men.<br><br>In the same year, 17.9&nbsp;% of school leavers (130,322&nbsp;individuals) attained a Erster Schulabschluss, 46.3&nbsp;% (336,361) obtained an intermediate qualification (Mittlerer Abschluss), 35.7&nbsp;% (259,230) achieved the general higher education entrance qualification (Allgemeine Hochschulreife), and 0.1&nbsp;% (802) acquired the Fachhochschulreife.<br><br>A longer-term comparison since the year 2000&nbsp;shows particularly significant changes for two types of qualifications: the share of school leavers with a lower secondary school qualification (Erster Schulabschluss) has declined by 9.7&nbsp;percentage points, while the share obtaining the general higher education entrance qualification has increased by 8.6&nbsp;percentage points&nbsp;–&nbsp;in each case relative to the total number of school leavers in the respective reporting year.</p>'
