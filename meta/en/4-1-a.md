national_indicator_available: Early leavers from education and training        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the percentage of all people in the 18&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;age group who neither possess a university entrance qualification, such as an Abitur or Fachhochschulreife (entrance qualification for universities of applied sciences), nor have completed a course of vocational training and who are not currently undergoing training or continuing education.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds in the same age group (in per cent) who have neither a higher education entrance qualification, such as the Abitur or Fachhochschulreife, nor completed vocational training and who are not currently participating in education and training measures.        

dns_indicator_intention: The federal educational system and the dual system of vocational training are the cornerstones of future-orientated qualifications for young people in Germany. Failure to complete school or vocational training poses a risk of poverty and places a strain on the social welfare systems. The target for 2030&nbsp;is to lower the percentage of early school leavers to 9.5&nbsp;%.        

dns_political_intention: The state education system and the dual system of vocational training are the cornerstones of future-oriented qualifications for young people in Germany. A lack of school and vocational qualifications means an increased risk of poverty and a resulting greater burden on the social security system.        

political_target: Reduce the proportion to 9.5&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The term “early school leavers” does not refer to the young “high achievers”, who obtain a school leaving certificate before the regular period of schooling ends. Nor should the term be confused with school drop-outs. On the contrary, it refers to people between 18&nbsp;and 24&nbsp;years of age who neither have obtained a higher education entrance qualification such as “Abitur” or “Fachhochschulreife” (for universities in general or universities of applied sciences), nor have completed vocational training and who are not attending initial and continuing education/ training programmes. This means that even those young people who, for example, have successfully completed “Hauptschule” or “Realschule” (lower secondary education, <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr> level 2) but are no longer participating in the education process are also counted as early school leavers.<br><br>The information originates from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1&nbsp;% of the population in Germany. In 2020, the microcensus had a comprehensive restructuring, such that data from 2020&nbsp;on is conditionally comparable to preceding years.<br><br>It is not possible to conclude what type of educational institution they last attended and at what time. The annual school statistics, which is a coordinated Länder statistics, provides supplementary information also published by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>In 2021, according to provisional results, the indicator value was 11.6&nbsp;%, <abbr title="that is to say (id est)" tabindex="0">i.e.</abbr> there were a total of 698,000&nbsp;young people without completed upper secondary education who were not or no longer undergoing (vocational) training or continuing education. The indicator value had decreased to 9.5&nbsp;% until 2014&nbsp;and, hence, achieved the target for 2030. From then on, the trend had moved in the wrong direction.<br><br>As for gender-specific indicator rates, there were no systematic differences between men and women for the period between 1999&nbsp;and 2005. Since 2006, the rate for women has been lower than that for men. The values in 2021, for instance, were 9.6&nbsp;% for women and 13.5&nbsp;% for men.<br><br>According to the school statistics, a total of some 47,490&nbsp;young people, or 6.2&nbsp;% of the resident population in the relevant age group, left school in 2021&nbsp;without a certificate of lower secondary education. Compared with 1999, this equates to a reduction by 43&nbsp;%. By this measure too, the proportion remains markedly lower among young women (4.9&nbsp;%) than among young men (7.5&nbsp;%).<br><br>By contrast, 16.1&nbsp;% (122,282) of the resident population of the same age obtained a certificate of lower secondary education from a Hauptschule in 2021, 44.1&nbsp;% (334,137) obtained a certificate of intermediate secondary education, 33.0&nbsp;% (263,428) obtained a general university entrance qualification, and 0.1&nbsp;% (849) obtained a certificate qualifying them to enter a university of applied sciences. Since 1999, two types of certificates have seen particularly large changes over the course of time. Thus, the share of people with a secondary general school certificate fell by 10.0&nbsp;percentage points, while the share of people with university entrance qualification rose by 8.2&nbsp;percentage points (both as a proportion of the population of the same age).</p>'
