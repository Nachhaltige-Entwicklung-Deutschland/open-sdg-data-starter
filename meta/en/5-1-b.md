national_indicator_available: Women on supervisory boards                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Although women are just as likely as men to graduate from a higher education institution and are as highly qualified as men, they are still under-represented in management positions in the German economy, particularly at senior management level. For this reason, the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies is to be increased to 30&nbsp;% by 2030.                   

indicator_name: Women in management positions in business                   
section: Equality                   
postulate: Promoting equal opportunities in society

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>This indicator measures the proportion of women on the supervisory boards of listed companies and joint-stock companies with more than 2,000 employees as well as European Companies (SE) and listed companies that are subject to equal co-determination. The data are based on publications of the results of elections at general meetings of shareholders of listed and fully co-determined companies, which are evaluated by the association “Frauen in die Aufsichtsräte” (FidAR). This currently includes 104 companies with almost 1,600 supervisory board positions.<br><br>In January 2018, the average proportion of women on the supervisory boards of these companies was 30.9&nbsp;%. In January 2015, the share was 21.3&nbsp;%. This means that the target share of 30&nbsp;% was already reached twelve years before the deadline set in the German Sustainability Strategy. Provided that the companies complied with the law, this increase was to be expected as the “Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions” since 2015 requires at least 30&nbsp;% of the supervisory board positions to be filled by women in all newly elected supervisory boards of the above-mentioned companies. Multiple counts of persons holding several supervisory board positions are not eliminated.<br><br>With regard to the results, it should also be noted that the majority of companies in Germany and most of the management positions in the economy are excluded by the underlying definition. On the one hand, the group of reporting entities currently comprises 104 companies according to the definition. However, there are nearly 3.5&nbsp;million companies in Germany in total. On the other hand, the roughly 1,600 supervisory board positions considered by FidAR to date represent only a small portion of management positions in the economy with its 816,000 managers in 2014. These numbers illustrate that only part of the management positions in a company are considered when the coverage is limited to the supervisory bodies.<br><br>According to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), managers are all persons who plan, control, coordinate and evaluate the overall activities of companies, governments and other organisations or internal organisational units and who review and evaluate guidelines, laws, rules and regulations. When the ISCO classification is applied, just under 21&nbsp;% of the 816,000 management positions in the economy (all companies with more than one employee) were filled by women in 2014.
