content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #c5192d; font-size: large">4.1.b Persons with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary level of education</b><br><br>The indicator reflects the proportion of 30- to 34-year-olds who hold either a tertiary academic qualification or an advanced vocational qualification. The name of the indicator is rooted in the tradition of Germany’s dual education system. In addition to tertiary education qualifications from universities, universities of applied sciences, public administration colleges, cooperative universities, and vocational or specialised academies, it also includes master craftsman and technician qualifications. Furthermore, the indicator takes into account a wide range of additional qualifications&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, completed vocational training after obtaining a university entrance qualification (Abitur) or qualifications in health and social care professions, such as training as a medical-technical assistant.<br><br>To enable international comparability of educational qualifications, the International Standard Classification of Education (<abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr>) is used. It assigns equivalent qualifications to standardised <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr> levels. The indicator includes both tertiary education qualifications (<abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr> levels 5&nbsp;to 8) and post-secondary, non-tertiary qualifications (<abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr> level 4).<br><br>The data source for this indicator is the Microcensus, an annual sample survey covering around 1&nbsp;% of the German population. Additional data are provided by the higher education statistics compiled by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>In 1999, the proportion of academically or vocationally highly qualified individuals in the relevant age group was 33.4&nbsp;%. By 2024, this figure had risen by 24.0&nbsp;percentage points to 57.3&nbsp;%. The politically defined target of 55&nbsp;% for 2030&nbsp;was already exceeded in 2023.<br><br>The gender ratio has also changed significantly over time. In 1999, the share among men was 3.8&nbsp;percentage points higher than among women. In 2006, both genders reached the same level. Since 2007, the proportion of women with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary qualification has consistently exceeded that of men. In 2024, 61.6&nbsp;% of women in this age group had achieved such a qualification, clearly surpassing the 55&nbsp;% target. Among men, the share was 53.3&nbsp;%, meaning the target is likely to be reached in the coming years.<br><br>In many other countries, there are no post-secondary, non-tertiary qualifications. For this reason, the internationally comparable indicator&nbsp;–&nbsp;as defined within the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>’s “Europe 2020” strategy&nbsp;–&nbsp;is narrower in scope, counting only tertiary qualifications (<abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education" tabindex="0">ISCED</abbr> levels 5&nbsp;to 8).<br><br>Among <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> member states, the value for this indicator was 44.7&nbsp;% in 2024, continuing a steady upward trend since 2005. In Germany, the corresponding figure was 42.3&nbsp;%, 2.4&nbsp;percentage points below the <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> average. Here too, a gender gap is evident: in 2024, 43.6&nbsp;% of women in Germany had a tertiary qualification compared to 41.1&nbsp;% of men.<br><br>The demand for skilled labour is not met by academically qualified individuals alone. Vocationally trained individuals are also increasingly needed to address the skilled labour shortage. However, the share of 30- to 34-year-olds who hold an initial vocational qualification (and do not additionally hold a tertiary or higher vocational qualification) has been steadily declining since 1999. In 2024, only 21.9&nbsp;% of people in this age group held such a qualification, compared to around 50&nbsp;% in 1999.<br><br>Overall, the potential skilled labour force&nbsp;–&nbsp;comprising academically qualified individuals, those with advanced vocational qualifications, and those with initial vocational training&nbsp;–&nbsp;has declined noticeably in recent years. Since 2021, the proportion of 30- to 34-year-olds classified as skilled workers has fallen below the 80&nbsp;% mark for the first time (2024: 79.2&nbsp;%).</p>'
