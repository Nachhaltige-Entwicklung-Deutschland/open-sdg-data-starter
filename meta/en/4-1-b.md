#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: 30 to 34-year-olds with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary level of education    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator specifies the proportion of 30 to 34-year-olds who hold a certificate from the tertiary education sector (levels 5 to 8 of the International Standard Classification of Education, ISCED, 2011) or a post-secondary non-tertiary certificate (level 4 of the ISCED).    

dns_indicator_intention: A highly developed economy such as Germany’s, in which the service sector and the demand for knowledge and expertise are becoming increasingly important, requires highly qualified workers. For this reason, the value of this indicator should increase to 42&nbsp;% by 2020. This objective is in line with the goal of the European Union’s “Europe 2020” strategy to ensure that 40&nbsp;% of the 30 to 34-year-olds in the European Union hold a tertiary certificate by 2020.

#Content    
content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The “International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)” enables international comparisons of statistics and indicators regarding certificates of education. Certificates that are regarded as equivalent are assigned to the same ISCED levels.<br><br><br><br>The data for the indicator originate from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1% of the population. The statistics of higher education provides supplementary information and is also compiled by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br><br><br>The name of the indicator is linked to the tradition of the dual education system in Germany. In addition to tertiary degrees from universities, universities of applied sciences, colleges of public administration, vocational and specialised academies as well as master craftsmen’s and technicians’ certificates, there are post-secondary non-tertiary degrees at upper secondary level which are obtained in parallel or consecutively. These include, for example, the “Abitur” (higher education entrance qualification) at evening schools or at two-year full-time vocational schools, the completion of vocational training after the “Abitur” or a previous vocational training. Therefore, the indicator includes both the tertiary degrees corresponding to levels 5 to 8 of the ISCED as well as the post-secondary non-tertiary degrees corresponding to level 4 of the ISCED.<br><br><br><br>Starting at 33.4&nbsp;% in 1999, the indicator increased by 15.5 percentage points to 48.8&nbsp;% in 2017 and has therefore been above the target value set for 2020 for some years now. This applies both to women (52.6&nbsp;%) and to men (45.2&nbsp;%). The ratio of gender-specific proportions has changed over time: in 1999, the value of the indicator was still 3.8 percentage points higher for men than for women. In 2006, the values for both genders were the same. Since 2007, the share of women who have completed a programme of tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary education has been higher than the share of men.<br><br><br><br>Many other countries do not offer post-secondary non-tertiary education programmes. Therefore, the European version of the indicator from the “Europe 2020” strategy is more narrowly defined and takes only tertiary degrees (ISCED levels 5-8) into account.<br><br><br><br>Following a steady increase since 2005, the European indicator reached a total of 39.9&nbsp;% across the EU-28 states in 2017. If one also uses this more narrowly defined indicator for Germany, the value of 34.0&nbsp;% obtained for 2017 was more than 5.9 percentage points below the EU value. Furthermore, in 2017, the proportion of women (34.2&nbsp;%) was slightly higher than that of men (33.8&nbsp;%; not shown in the chart).<br><br><br><br>The number of university graduates in Germany totalled 501,734 in 2017. Compared to 1999, this is an increase of 126.3&nbsp;%. These included 129,646 engineering graduates (206.2&nbsp;% more than in 1999) and 55,133 graduates of mathematics and the natural sciences (69.4&nbsp;% more than in 1999)."
