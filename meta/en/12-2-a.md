national_indicator_available: Using the EMAS eco-management system in Germany                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of locations of organisations registered in Germany for EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme).                   

dns_indicator_intention: Climate change, the energy transition and resource constraints are presenting companies with new challenges. As a result, they have to reshape their business processes, structures and products in an environmentally friendly and resource-saving manner. The EMAS environmental management system offers a concept of systematic corporate environmental protection and is associated with the goal of continuously improving the environmental performance of the organisation’s locations. For this reason, the target is to present a total of 5,000 locations of organisations complying with the EMAS environmental management system by 2030.                   

indicator_name: EMAS eco-management                   
section: Responsible production                   
postulate: Increasing the proportion of sustainable production continuously

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>EMAS is a voluntary instrument of the European Union that helps companies and organisations of any size in any sector to continuously improve their environmental performance. EMAS is associated with an environmental reporting obligation (called an environmental statement) that contains the most important environmental impacts of the company in question and involves the compulsory provision of data on the topics of energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, waste and land use/biodiversity. Internal documents as well as the environmental statement are inspected by independent, government-approved environmental verifiers.<br><br>Organisations that pass the inspection, which have not violated legal requirements relating to the environment and against which no complaints have been made, are accepted into the EMAS register. The inspection must be repeated on a regular basis, no later than every three years. The Environmental Verification Committee1 is responsible for quality control. The environmental statement must be updated by the organisations annually; however, small and medium-sized companies may do so every two years since 2010, upon request. EMAS organisations and locations are registered by the responsible Chambers of Commerce and Industry or Crafts and listed in a publicly accessible database at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Data recorded using a standardised methodology are available from 2005 onwards.<br><br>In terms of methodology, note that the EMAS register shows the number of registrations. Participating organisations are free to include several locations under a single organisation registration (collective registration) or to have locations registered individually. Some companies have partly also registered their foreign locations in Germany. These are also contained in the EMAS register, but are not included in the number of EMAS locations shown here. Statistical data are available regarding the number of registered organisations and the number of locations, irrespective of whether they are part of a registered organisation (collective registration) or are registered as independent locations.<br><br>In 2017, a total of 2,176 EMAS locations were registered in Germany. This was an increase of 11.1&nbsp;% compared with 2005. If we look at the development over the last five years, the indicator has on average been moving gradually in the direction of the set target. If the development continues without change, the goal for 2030 will nevertheless not be achieved.<br><br>The 2,176 EMAS locations registered in Germany in 2017 belonged to a total of 1,240 organisations, which were distributed very unevenly across the country. The majority of them were based in Baden-Württemberg (396) and Bavaria (288), followed by North Rhine-Westphalia (115). In contrast, there were just five organisations in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Broken down by economic activities, 37.6&nbsp;% of the organisations were allocated to manufacturing, 9.8&nbsp;% to other service activities, 9.5&nbsp;% to accommodation and food service activities and 7.6&nbsp;% to the education sector in 2017.<br><br>The registered organisations employed a total of 985,195 people in 2017. This was an increase of 2.5&nbsp;% compared with 2005.
