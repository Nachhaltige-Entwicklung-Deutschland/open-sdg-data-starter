national_indicator_available: Corruption Perceptions Index in Germany and in partner countries for German development cooperation        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators shows Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>) for Germany (16.3.a) and the number of partner countries of German development cooperation whose <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> has improved compared to 2012&nbsp;(16.3.b). The <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> measures the extent to which corruption in the public sector is perceived in a country.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Corruption undermines trust in institutions and political measures to increase sustainability and hinders social justice. A low level of corruption, on the other hand, promotes transparent governance, efficient resource utilisation and stable economic conditions. Corruption should therefore be combated both in Germany and in the partner countries of German development cooperation.

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #00689d; font-size: large">16.3.a, b Corruption Perceptions Index in Germany and in partner countries for German development cooperation</b><br><br>The Corruption Perceptions Index (<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>) is a composite indicator that aggregates, for each country, the results of various expert and business surveys on the subjectively perceived level of corruption in the public sector. Transparency International compiles the <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> once at least three different corruption perception surveys are available for a given country. The underlying surveys and their methodologies may vary over time and are based on differing definitions of corruption.<br><br>Survey results may also be influenced by the fact that respondents are aware of previous <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> scores or of the findings of the underlying sub-studies, which can shape their perceptions. These factors, along with differences in perception, limit the comparability of results both over time (longitudinally) and across countries (cross-sectionally).<br><br>The Joint Research Centre (<abbr title="Joint Research Centre" tabindex="0">JRC</abbr>) of the European Commission notes in its analysis that statistical significance should always be considered when interpreting results. Even in the case of statistically significant changes, the indicator should be interpreted with caution.<br><br>Germany’s score has declined from 79&nbsp;points in 2012&nbsp;to 75&nbsp;points in 2024. Compared with the peak of 81&nbsp;points recorded between 2015&nbsp;and 2017, this represents a decrease of six points. Germany currently ranks 15th out of 180&nbsp;assessed countries. The change compared with 2012&nbsp;is statistically significant at the 10% significance level.<br><br>The Federal Statistical Office also collects data on perceived corruption as part of its satisfaction survey on public service delivery. In 2023, 11.6% of the population reported that, in their interactions with public authorities, they had the impression that officials were open to bribery. This figure is markedly higher than in previous years: compared with 2021&nbsp;(3.9%), it has tripled. Among surveyed businesses, however, the value remained broadly stable over the years: in 2023, 3.4% expressed the view that public sector employees were open to bribery.<br><br>The Police Crime Statistics (<abbr title="Police Crime Statistics" tabindex="0">PCS</abbr>) record all criminal offences known to the police. In 2024, a total of 976&nbsp;cases of acceptance or granting of advantages, as well as bribery and corruption in the public sector, were registered. While this was lower than the previous year’s figure of 1,094&nbsp;cases (2023), it remained well above the average of 842&nbsp;cases recorded between 2020&nbsp;and 2023.<br><br>The <abbr title="Police Crime Statistics" tabindex="0">PCS</abbr> also records cases in the business domain. In 2024, 197&nbsp;cases of <i>bribery and corruption in commercial transactions and in the healthcare sector</i> were recorded&nbsp;–&nbsp;significantly fewer than in the previous year (369&nbsp;cases in 2023). In addition, the PKS covers so-called related offences to corruption, including fraud, breach of trust, forgery, collusive tendering, obstruction of justice, false certification in office, and breach of official secrecy.<br><br>With regard to German development cooperation, 32&nbsp;of the 63&nbsp;<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>-assessed partner countries have improved since 2012. The number of partner countries showing positive development generally increased over the observation period, with slight declines in 2018, 2022, and in the current reporting year compared with 2023. In 2024, a total of 21&nbsp;partner countries in German development cooperation recorded a statistically significant improvement over 2012&nbsp;at the 10% significance level.</p>'
