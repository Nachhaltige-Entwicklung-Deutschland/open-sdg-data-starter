national_indicator_available: Corruption Perceptions Index in Germany and in partner countries for German development cooperation        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicators represent Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>) for Germany (16.3.a) and the number of partner countries of German development cooperation whose <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> has improved compared to 2012&nbsp;(16.3.b). The <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> measures the extent to which corruption in the public sector is perceived in a country.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Corruption undermines trust in institutions and political measures to increase sustainability and hinders social justice. A low level of corruption, on the other hand, promotes transparent governance, efficient resource utilisation and stable economic conditions. Corruption should therefore be combated both in Germany and in the partner countries of German development cooperation.

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #00689d; font-size: large">16.3.a, b Corruption Perceptions Index in Germany and in partner countries for German development cooperation</b><br><br>The Corruption Perceptions Index (<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>) is a composite indicator that summarises, for each country, the results of various expert and business surveys on perceived levels of public sector corruption. The <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> is compiled by Transparency International once at least three different surveys assessing corruption perceptions are available for a given country. These surveys and their methodologies may vary over time and are based on different definitions of corruption. The results may also be influenced by the fact that respondents are aware of previous <abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr> scores or the findings of the underlying surveys, which could shape their perception. These factors, along with the subjective nature of perceptions, limit the comparability of results both over time and across countries.<br><br>The Joint Research Centre (<abbr title="Joint Research Centre" tabindex="0">JRC</abbr>) of the European Commission highlights in its analysis that changes in results must be interpreted with consideration of their statistical significance. However, even where differences are statistically significant, the indicator should be interpreted with caution. As a result, comparability is significantly limited both temporally and cross-nationally.<br><br>Germany’s score has declined from 79&nbsp;in 2012&nbsp;to 75&nbsp;in 2024. Compared to the years 2015&nbsp;to 2017, when Germany reached its highest score of 81, this represents a six-point drop. Germany currently ranks 15th out of 180&nbsp;countries assessed. The change since 2012&nbsp;is considered statistically significant (at a 10&nbsp;% significance level).<br><br>The Federal Statistical Office also collects data on perceptions of corruption as part of its satisfaction survey on public services. In 2023, 11.6&nbsp;% of the population reported having had the impression during interactions with public authorities that officials were susceptible to bribery. In previous years, these figures were significantly lower. Compared to 2021&nbsp;(3.9&nbsp;%), the value has tripled. Among surveyed businesses, however, the share has remained stable over time: in 2023, 3.4&nbsp;% reported the impression that public service employees were open to bribery.<br><br>The Police Crime Statistics (<abbr title="Police Crime Statistics" tabindex="0">PKS</abbr>) record all criminal offences known to the police. In 2024, a total of 976&nbsp;cases of accepting or offering advantages, as well as bribery and corruption in the public sector, were recorded. This was lower than in the previous year (1,094&nbsp;cases in 2023) but still above average (mean for 2020–2023: 842). The <abbr title="Police Crime Statistics" tabindex="0">PKS</abbr> also includes corruption-related offences in the private sector. In 2024, 197&nbsp;cases of “bribery and corruption in business and the healthcare sector” were registered&nbsp;–&nbsp;significantly fewer than in previous years (369&nbsp;cases in 2023). The <abbr title="Police Crime Statistics" tabindex="0">PKS</abbr> also captures offences commonly associated with corruption, such as fraud, breach of trust, forgery, collusive tendering, obstruction of justice, false certification by public officials, and breaches of official secrecy.<br><br>In the context of German development cooperation, 32&nbsp;of the 63&nbsp;<abbr title="Corruption Perception Index" tabindex="0">CPI</abbr>-assessed partner countries showed improvement in 2024&nbsp;compared to 2012. The number of countries demonstrating positive developments has generally increased during most years of the observation period, with slight declines in 2018&nbsp;and 2022. A small decrease is also evident in the current reporting year compared to 2023. A statistically significant improvement (at a 10&nbsp;% significance level) was observed in 21&nbsp;partner countries of German development cooperation between 2012&nbsp;and 2024.</p>'
