#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Nitrogen surplus in agriculture    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator represents the annual nitrogen surplus for the agricultural sector, calculated as nitrogen input minus removal of nitrogen, in kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area.    

dns_indicator_intention: Excess nitrogen input into the environment causes pollution of groundwater and surface water, the oversupply of nutrients (eutrophication) in inland waters, lakes and onshore ecosystems, the generation of greenhouse gases and acidifying atmospheric pollutants, each with negative consequences for the climate, biodiversity and landscape quality. For the period 2028 to 2032, a reduction of the nitrogen surpluses of the overall balance for Germany to 70 kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area on an annual average should be achieved.    

indicator_name: Nitrogen surplus in agriculture    
section: Farming    
postulate: Environmentally sound production in our cultivated landscapes    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Institute for Crop and Soil Science at the Julius Kühn Institute and the Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the University of Giessen. The calculation takes into account nitrogen inputs by fertilisers, from biological nitrogen fixation, by atmospheric inputs which are not emitted by agriculture, by seed and planting material as well as imported and domestically produced feedstuff. Nitrogen removal results from plant and animal market products.<br><br><br><br>In 2016, fertilisers were the most important component of nitrogen input in the overall balance, accounting for 55.1&nbsp;% (107 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare and year). Domestic feedstuff contributed 22.4&nbsp;% (43&nbsp;kg/ha) to nitrogen input, foreign feedstuff 12.1&nbsp;% (23&nbsp;kg/ha), the biological nitrogen fixation 6.6&nbsp;% (13&nbsp;kg/ha), the non-agricultural emissions 2.0&nbsp;% (4&nbsp;kg/ha) and seed and planting material 0.7&nbsp;% (1&nbsp;kg/ha). While the nitrogen input was reduced by about 9&nbsp;% between 1990 and 2016, the nitrogen removal increased considerably more (by 41&nbsp;%) between 1990 and 2016. In 2016, almost three quarters of the nitrogen removal from agriculture was accounted for by plant products and one quarter by animal market products.<br><br><br><br>The total balance of the indicator is calculated based on the concept of the “Hoftor-Bilanz” (farmgate balance), thus nitrogen flows within the operational cycle are not taken into account. The relevant time series for the indicator is based on the moving five-year average of the total balances of the relevant year as well as the two preceding and subsequent years. Thereby, yearly meteorological and market fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by farms, are balanced. The indicator does not provide an interpretation regarding the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses. Even if the average value, defined as a national target for Germany, is not reached, regional nitrogen surpluses can be considerably higher than 70&nbsp;kg per hectare and year.<br><br><br><br>During the period from 1992 to 2014, the nitrogen balance fell from 121 to 97&nbsp;kg per hectare and year (– 19.5&nbsp;%). Following the major reduction in nitrogen surpluses at the beginning of the time series, the nitrogen surplus fell by only 0.9&nbsp;% between 2010 and 2014. If this trend continues, decreasing the nitrogen surplus to 70&nbsp;kg/ha of utilised agricultural area on annual average between 2028 and 2032 may not be possible.<br><br><br><br>The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus in the early 1990s resulted from diminished use of fertilisers and falling numbers of livestock in the new Länder. The marginal decline of the indicator in the remaining course of the time series is based on a minor reduction in mineral fertiliser use and improved harvest yields resulting from technical advances in plant production and breeding (more efficient nitrogen fertilisation, variety spectrum) combined with the simultaneous expansion in the cultivation of high-yield crop types (maize, wheat) as well as improved feed conversion by livestock.<br><br><br><br>The indicator reveals a direct connection to the indicators 3.2.a “Emissions of air pollutants”, 6.1.b “Nitrate in groundwater”, 14.1.a “Nitrogen input to the North and the Baltic Sea through German inflows” and 15.2 “Eutrophication of ecosystems”.
