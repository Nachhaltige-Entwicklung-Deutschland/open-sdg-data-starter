national_indicator_available: Gross domestic product per capita                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the price-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (inhabitant) in Germany based on the year 2010. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced domestically; inhabitants are all those people whose permanent residence is in Germany.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Changes in GDP are related in a variety of ways to other indicators included within the National Sustainability Strategy. Social factors such as the population structure, the labour supply, the educational system and social cohesion play an important role in society with regard to international economic competitiveness. GDP is an important indicator of a nation’s economic strength and growth. Consequently, the goal is to achieve continuous and appropriate levels of growth.

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>GDP expresses the total economic output produced within the country in a reference period. The focus in this context is primarily on goods and services that are traded on markets as well as on public goods and services. GDP is determined quarterly and annually by the Federal Statistical Office in accordance with rules that are harmonised throughout Europe. Due to the early calculation dates, many of the necessary basic data are not available in time for the first release date. Instead, the first release is still largely based on indicators and estimates. Missing information is initially estimated or carried forward. The data basis is subsequently improved with additional statistics, which are successively incorporated into the calculations. Only after around four years are all basic statistics available, and the data are then classified as “final”.<br><br>GDP and other standard aggregates of the European System of National and Regional Accounts represent an important part of the material wealth, namely, income generated primarily in the market and its use. However, GDP is not suitable for use as a welfare indicator, because an assessment of material wealth is not sufficient to achieve a comprehensive calculation of well-being and quality of life. This requires additional indicators, for example, to cover unpaid work in households, which is not included in the calculation of GDP. Also, the distribution of income (and assets) among different population groups is not shown by GDP.<br><br>The GDP is also a pure flow parameter that generally refers to the period of a quarter or a year. The change of stock variables is not recorded – with the exception of the capital stock through the calculation of fixed capital formation and consumption of fixed capital. Key economic variables such as stocks and qualities of human capital (such as education, health), of social capital (such as security, integration) and of natural capital (such as resources, ecosystems) are excluded. Statements as to whether GDP and its growth have led to capital preservation in a broad sense are therefore not possible. Consequently, on the basis of GDP, no statements regarding the sustainability of the economic growth can be made.<br><br>The GDP per capita is calculated on the basis of the average population figures of the Federal Statistical Office, which are recalculated and rolled forward according to the 2011 Census.<br><br>Between 1991 and 2017, the price-adjusted gross domestic product per capita increased by a total 39.2&nbsp;%. Following a strong year-on-year GDP growth averaging a 2.9&nbsp;% annual increase over the period 2005 to 2008, GDP per capita fell by 5.3&nbsp;% in 2009 on the previous year as a result of the global financial market and economic crisis. Economic output then recovered and in 2011 GDP exceeded the 2008 level. If one considers the average development of 1.5&nbsp;% over the last five years, the indicator has developed in a positive direction. In 2017, the figure was just under 35,500 euros per capita.
