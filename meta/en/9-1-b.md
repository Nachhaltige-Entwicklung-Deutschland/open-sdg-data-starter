national_indicator_available: Rollout of broadband&nbsp;–&nbsp;Share of households with access to gigabit broadband services        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of households with access to gigabit broadband (in %). It shows the development of technically installed broadband availability among households in Germany for gigabit connections (≥ 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr>) via pure fibre optic networks (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>), cable television (<abbr title="Cable Television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr>) and all wired technologies.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: In addition to increasing international competitiveness, the expansion of broadband availability at gigabit speeds should enable equal living conditions in Germany. In order to achieve these goals, in addition to the predominantly private-sector expansion, state funding measures should also support the expansion in uneconomical areas.        

political_target: Universal gigabit network rollout by 2025        

type_target: Target with specific target value        

data_state: 23.06.2025

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #fd6925; font-size: large">9.1.b Rollout of broadband&nbsp;–&nbsp;Share of households with access to gigabit broadband services</b><br><br>The indicator reflects the availability of broadband connections with a downstream speed of at least 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr> (gigabit) in German private households. It covers wired technologies such as fibre to the building or home (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>) and hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC, formerly cable television). The data basis for the analysis is regularly updated coverage data from over 150&nbsp;telecommunications providers.<br><br>As of the end of 2024, fibre connections offering speeds of at least 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr> are available to 39.8% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2024, the availability of <abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr> connections with at least 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr> increased by 33.1&nbsp;percentage points, representing an almost sixfold rise (+494%). From the end of 2018&nbsp;to the end of 2024, the proportion of households with access to 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr> via HFC rose from 23.7% to 62.4%, more than doubling (+163%). Altogether, by the end of 2024, gigabit-capable wired connections are available to 77.9% of all private households.<br><br>Gigabit broadband availability across all wired technologies is particularly concentrated in densely populated areas. In such areas, 90.4% of households have access to at least one gigabit connection. In medium-density areas, the proportion is significantly lower at 76.9%, and in sparsely populated areas, availability is only 51.5%.<br><br>When considering only gigabit fibre connections, the regional disparity is less pronounced: By the end of 2024, 42.5% of households in densely populated areas have access to a gigabit-capable fibre connection. In both medium- and low-density areas, the proportion is around 38%.<br><br>There are also differences in availability across the Länder. Among the larger territorial states, Schleswig-Holstein reports the highest proportion of households with access to gigabit connections via all technologies, at 91.6% in 2024, followed by Niedersachsen with 86.3%. The lowest availability is in Thüringen (55.7%), followed by Sachsen-Anhalt (62.8%). In comparison, the three city-states&nbsp;–&nbsp;Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg&nbsp;–&nbsp;each have a gigabit availability rate of over 95%, significantly exceeding the national average for densely populated areas.<br><br>Despite the progress made, the political target of nationwide fixed-line gigabit coverage by 2025&nbsp;is unlikely to be fully achieved.</p>'

target_description: The share of households with access to gigabit broadband services should be increased to 100% by 2025.<br><br><br>• According to the target formulation, if the average rate of increase observed between 2019&nbsp;and 2024&nbsp;(each based on second-half-of-year values) continues, only around 85% of households will have such access by 2025. Indicator 9.1.b is therefore assessed as <b>cloud</b> for 2024.
