national_indicator_available: Rollout of broadband&nbsp;–&nbsp;Share of households with access to gigabit broadband services        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the development of broadband availability for households in Germany in terms of the technology installed, with separate figures for gigabit connections (≥ 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbps</abbr>) using fully fibre-optic networks (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>), cable television (<abbr title="Cable television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr>) and other types of wired technology.        

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the proportion of households with access to gigabit broadband (in per cent). It shows the development of technically installed broadband availability among households in Germany for gigabit connections (≥ 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbit/s</abbr>) via pure fibre optic networks (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>), cable television (<abbr title="Cable television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr>) and all wired technologies.        

dns_indicator_intention: The nationwide roll-out of gigabit networks by 2025&nbsp;is one of the German Government’s key objectives. In addition to enhancing international competitiveness, the expansion of broadband availability with gigabit speeds is intended to facilitate the convergence of living standards across Germany. To achieve these aims, the predominantly private sector roll-out is to be supported by public funding schemes in unprofitable areas.        

dns_political_intention: In addition to increasing international competitiveness, the expansion of broadband availability at gigabit speeds should enable equal living conditions in Germany. In order to achieve these goals, in addition to the predominantly private-sector expansion, state funding measures should also support the expansion in uneconomical areas.        

political_target: Universal gigabit network rollout by 2025        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator measures the availability of broadband to households in Germany at downstream speeds of at least 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbps</abbr>, or one gigabit per second, using wired technology&nbsp;–&nbsp;fibre optics (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>) and cable television (<abbr title="Cable television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr>). The figures are collated on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and published on the Government’s Broadband Atlas.<br><br>As of the middle of 2021, fully fibre-optic internet connections (<abbr title="Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home" tabindex="0">FTTB/H</abbr>) capable of more than 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbps</abbr> were available in 15.4&nbsp;% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the availability of 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbps</abbr> FTTB/H broadband rose by 8.7&nbsp;percentage points. In other words, it more than doubled, increasing by +&nbsp;130&nbsp;%. From the end of 2018&nbsp;to the middle of 2021, the proportion of households with equally rapid connections using <abbr title="Cable television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr> grew from 23.7&nbsp;% to 56.5&nbsp;%. This is also more than double, equating to a +&nbsp;138&nbsp;% increase. Altogether, 62.1&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-capable connections available as of mid-2021.<br><br>For all technologies, the provision of gigabit broadband is concentrated particularly in urban areas, where some 78.4&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-speed internet access as of 2021. That figure is markedly lower for areas of a rural character, at 22.9&nbsp;% in 2021. To consider the distribution of the different technologies, 75.1&nbsp;% of urban and 12.8&nbsp;% of rural households had gigabit connections via <abbr title="Cable television" tabindex="0">CATV</abbr> in mid-2021, while gigabit-capable fibre broadband was available to 18.6&nbsp;% of households in urban areas and 11.3&nbsp;% of those in rural areas.<br><br>Differences in availability between urban and more rural areas are also discernible among the Länder. Of all the Länder that are not city states, Schleswig-Holstein has the highest level of gigabit-speed provision using any technology in 2021, at 79.7&nbsp;% of all households, followed by Niedersachsen on 66.8&nbsp;%. At the other end of the scale, 26&nbsp;% of households in Sachsen-Anhalt can say the same, with Brandenburg the next-lowest at 29.4&nbsp;%. In contrast, provision of gigabit-speed broadband is markedly higher than 90&nbsp;% in the three city states, Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.<br><br>The foundation for the distinction between urban and rural areas is solely the population density for this indicator. The information about gigabit broadband are collected from more than 150&nbsp;telecommunications companies in Germany. They are asked about their current provision. To preserve the companies’ business and trade secrets, the resultant data are aggregated into a grid of 250-metre by 250-metre cells (from 2022: 100x100&nbsp;metre) and grouped according to seven classes of broadband. Although full-fibre networks with speeds of over 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title="Megabit per second" tabindex="0">Mbps</abbr> have been included in observations since the end of 2015, that class has only been studied in detail since the end of 2018&nbsp;in light of the latest technological advances.<br><br>Methodologically, it should be noted that the telecom companies provide their data on broadband availability on a voluntary basis until the revision of the Telecommunications Act on 1&nbsp;December 2021. Furthermore, the figures for availability refer to the technology that telecom companies have installed, as opposed to the actually usable broadband capacity in the area. Additional information on broadband measurement can be found in the annual report of the Bundesnetzagentur, Germany’s federal networks agency.</p>'

target_description: The proportion of households with access to gigabit broadband is to be increased to 100&nbsp;per cent by 2025.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, if the average increase of the years 2019&nbsp;to 2024&nbsp;continues (the values of the second half of the year are taken into account in each case), only around 85&nbsp;per cent of households will have a corresponding connection by 2025. Indicator 9.1.b is rated as "Cloud" for the year 2024.
