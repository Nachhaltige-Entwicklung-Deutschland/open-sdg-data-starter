national_indicator_available: Accessibility of recreational green spaces in cities        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: As a weighted average across all cities with more than 20,000&nbsp;inhabitants, the indicator shows the proportion of the population (in %) living within walking distance (maximum 300&nbsp;m as the crow flies) of green spaces suitable for recreation with a defined minimum size of one hectare.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Urban nature close to neighbourhoods offers the urban population important spaces for recreation, exercise, sport, experiencing nature and socialising and ensures adaptation to weather extremes, <abbr title="for example" tabindex="0">e.g.</abbr> through cooling during periods of heat, fresh air production or rain retention during heavy rainfall events. It is therefore of great importance for environmental justice and quality of life, including physical and mental well-being.        

political_target: Green areas, parks <abbr title="and so on" tabindex="0">etc.</abbr> in cities should be within walking distance for everyone in future        

type_target: Directional target
