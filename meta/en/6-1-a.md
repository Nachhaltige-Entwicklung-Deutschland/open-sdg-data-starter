#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Phosphorus in flowing waters    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the percentage of monitoring sites at which the benchmark values for good ecological status are achieved for the relevant water types with regard to phosphorus in flowing waters.    

dns_indicator_intention: Roughly half of the phosphorus entering flowing water in Germany today comes from agriculture, and the other half is from cities (municipal water treatment plants and rainwater run-off).<br><br>Together with nitrate pollution, it is one of the reasons why a surfeit of nutrients (eutrophication) occurs in rivers, lakes and seas. The consequences of this are algae growth, oxygen depletion and even fish mortality or the growth of toxic blue-green algae. For this reason, adherence at all monitoring sites to the benchmark values indicated in the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (Oberflächengewässerverordnung) for the relevant water types was defined as a goal for 2030.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021</i><br><br>The pollution of rivers with phosphorus is measured by the Länder as part of their monitoring under the EU Water Framework Directive. The data used for the indicator are taken from the surveillance network, which comprises some 250 monitoring sites. In most cases, the monitoring sites were established in the main flows of the large rivers and at the mouths of important tributaries. The data are compiled by the Federal Environment Agency on the basis of information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the Länder and the Federal Government (LAWA).<br><br>Each of the figures used to calculate the indicator value shows whether the annual average reading from a particular monitoring site adhered to or fell below the benchmark value but not the extent to which the threshold was exceeded. The information from the individual monitoring sites is presented in aggregated form. Accordingly, the value of the indicator depends on the number of monitoring sites and how representative their distribution is. Lakes and other bodies of water are not covered by the indicator.
