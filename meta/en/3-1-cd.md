national_indicator_available: Adolescent and adult smokers                   

dns_indicator_definition: The smoking rate among adolescents (3.1.c) reflects the share of 12 to 17-year-olds who indicate that they smoke regularly or occasionally. The smoking rate among adults (3.1.d) indicates the share of those surveyed aged 15 and above who answered the questions in the microcensus regarding smoking behaviour and who smoke regularly or occasionally.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Smoking poses a risk of serious health impairment and premature death, and this risk is not confined to smokers themselves. Non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke do not just suffer annoyance but can also fall ill from it. The Federal Government is pursuing the goal of reducing the percentage of adolescent smokers to under 7&nbsp;% by 2030, and that of all smokers aged 15 years and older to 19&nbsp;%.

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data for adolescents have been collected since 1973 (since 1993 also in the new LÃ¤nder) by the Federal Centre for Health Education through telephone interviews within the scope of surveys of substance consumption conducted among adolescents and young adults. Initially, the survey took place every three to four years and has been conducted almost annually since 2001. Interim years in which no survey was conducted have been interpolated for the time series. In 2016, the random sample used comprised 7,003 adolescents and young adults. For trend analysis, the data are weighted by sex, region and age.<br><br>The data for adults are collected every four years as part of the microcensus conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. The interim years without a survey were interpolated for the presentation of the indicator time series. The microcensus is a sample survey covering 1&nbsp;% of the total population and it is the largest household survey in Germany and Europe. The responses to the questions regarding smoking habits are voluntary and were provided by 79&nbsp;% of those surveyed in 2017.<br><br>In the group of adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age, the proportion of smokers initially increased from 24&nbsp;% (1995) to 28&nbsp;% (1997 and 2001), but then declined steadily to 7&nbsp;% by 2016. In this context, there appears to be no difference in smoking behaviour between the genders. If the trend seen in recent years continues, the target value set for 2030 will be achieved in the near future.<br><br>In 2017, a total of 22&nbsp;% of the overall population above the age of 15 indicated that they smoked occasionally or regularly. This compares with a figure of 28&nbsp;% in the years from 1995 to 1999. This means that the rate for adult smokers had declined only slightly. If the trend based on the average of the last five years continues, the target for this sub-indicator will also be fulfilled.<br><br>In 2017, 19&nbsp;% of all adults aged 15 years or older considered themselves regular smokers, while 4&nbsp;% smoked occasionally (the deviation in the total is due to rounding). The rate among women (19&nbsp;%) was significantly lower than for men (26&nbsp;%). While the proportion of women decreased by 3 percentage points since 1995, the proportion of male smokers decreased by 9 percentage points. <br><br>In 2017, 96&nbsp;% of the smokers surveyed preferred cigarettes. The level of tobacco consumption is important when considering the individual threat to health. Eleven percent of regular cigarette smokers were in the category of heavy smokers (1995: 17&nbsp;%) with a consumption of more than 20 cigarettes a day, whereas 81&nbsp;% smoked 5 to 20 cigarettes a day. In this case, there were differences between the genders. Almost one in seven of male regular cigarette smokers was a heavy smoker, but only one in thirteen of the female smokers.<br><br>Smoking poses a high and at the same time avoidable risk to health. In 2015, 5.1&nbsp;% of all deaths (3.4&nbsp;% among women, 6.8&nbsp;% among men) could be attributed to typical diseases of smokers (lung, bronchial, laryngeal and tracheal cancer). In 2015, the average age of those who died of lung, bronchial, and tracheal cancers was 70.6 years, that is, seven years below the average age of all deaths (78.4 years). A reduction in the number of smokers would therefore help reduce premature mortality."

data_footnote: "Data for adults were surveyed in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2017. The data for the intermediate years were interpolated. The data for the young people were surveyed in all years since 2003 except 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2017. In these intermediate years the data were interpolated. The data of the federal states for the smoking rate of adolescents are surveyed by the Federal Centre for Health Education using computer-assisted telephone interviews. However, the number of respondents is too small to make representative statements at the level of the federal states (survey 2018: 7 002 persons aged 12 to 25 years)."
