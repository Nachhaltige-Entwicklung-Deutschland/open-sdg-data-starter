#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Premature mortality    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicators comprise deaths among women (3.1 a) and men (3.1 b) in the population below 70 years of age with reference to 100,000 inhabitants of the “old” standardised European population below 70 years (excluding those less than 1 year old).    

dns_indicator_intention: By 2030, premature mortality among women (3.1.a) should not exceed 100, and for men (3.1.b), it should not exceed 190 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.    

indicator_name: Premature mortality    
section: Health and nutrition    
postulate: Living healthy longer    

#Content    
content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The data sources of the indicators are the causes of death statistics and the population statistics produced by the Federal Statistical Office. As part of the causes of death statistics, all official cause of death certificates are recorded and evaluated. The population statistics specify the current population based on the results of the most recent census. The data refer to the “old” standardised European population of 1976. Those under 1 year of age and consequently the infant mortality rate are excluded from the assessment. The indicator is also part of the Federal Health Monitoring information system.<br><br><br><br>Premature mortality steadily decreased between 1991 and 2015, both for women (– 36%) and for men (– 42%). As a result of this decrease, the gender difference in premature mortality declined, too. In 2015, for example, 153 women and 288 men per 100,000 inhabitants died before they reached the age of 70. If this trend continues unchanged as seen in recent years, the gender-specific targets for 2030 will not be achieved.<br><br><br><br>In accordance with the steady decrease in premature mortality, the trend for life expectancy in Germany continued developing in a positive direction. 70-year-old women today can expect, statistically, to live another 16.9 years and 70-year-old men another 14.2 years.<br><br><br><br>Between 2014 and 2016, the average life expectancy was 83.2 years for new-born girls and 78.3 years for boys, which was 0.5 years higher for girls and 0.6 years for boys than the average for the years 2009 to 2011. Differences in life expectancy between the western Länder and the eastern Länder (each excluding Berlin) are to be seen only among new-born boys. In this case, the difference is 1.3 years.<br><br><br><br>The largest share of all causes of premature mortality in 2015 was malignant neoplasms (37.8&nbsp;%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (21.4&nbsp;%). Deaths due to external causes (such as accidents, poisoning, suicide) accounted for as much as 8.8&nbsp;%. Diseases of the digestive and respiratory tracts contributed 6.9&nbsp;% and 5.5&nbsp;%, respectively, to the causes of death. Since 1991, the shares of malignant neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory tract among all causes of death have increased (by 13.8&nbsp;% and 36.7&nbsp;%, respectively). In contrast, causes such as cardiovascular diseases (– 31.2&nbsp;%), external causes (– 20.2&nbsp;%) and diseases of the digestive tract (– 9.9&nbsp;%) have declined.<br><br><br><br>Besides factors such as health behaviour (see also indicators 3.1.c, d Smoking rate among adolescents and adults or 3.1.e and 3.1.f Obesity rate among adolescents and adults), medical care also plays an important role in the mortality rate. Expenditure on health care rose to 357 billion euros in 2016 – corresponding to an increase of 12 billion euros, or 3.8&nbsp;%, compared with 2015. This level of spending represented 11.3&nbsp;% of the gross domestic product or 4,330 euros per capita (2015: 4,205 euros)."
