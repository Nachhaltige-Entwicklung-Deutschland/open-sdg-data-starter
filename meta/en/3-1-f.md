#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Obesity rate among adults    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the proportion of adults (aged 18 years and older) suffering from obesity in the total adult population.    

dns_indicator_intention: Excess weight plays a crucial role in the emergence of diseases of civilisation, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and joint injuries. Besides its consequences to health, excess weight is a burden on the national economy and has a negative impact on social life. Consequently, the proportion of the population with obesity in Germany should not increase any further.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>Obesity is determined with the help of the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual’s height in metres. People with a BMI of 25 and above are classified as “overweight” according to the WHO and those with a BMI of 30 as “obese”. The BMI is a benchmark that does not take account of the physique, age- and gender-specific differences as well as the individual body mass composition. <br><br><br><br>The data used for the indicator are based on the microcensus of the Federal Statistical Office. The sample survey is conducted among 1&nbsp;% of the total population. The responses to the health questions, which are generally asked every four years, are voluntary. Consequently, the indicator is based on the proportion of the population with a BMI of 30 and higher that also answered the microcensus questions concerning body weight and body size. The corresponding data were standardised relative to the European population of 1990 to allow data from different years and regions to be compared without distortions due to different age structures. Since the questions on health in the microcensus are not asked annually, the interim years in the chart were interpolated.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, 14.6&nbsp;% of the population in Germany over the age of 18 were obese. Here, the share of obese men (16.3&nbsp;%) was higher than the share of obese women (12.9&nbsp;%). Before, in 1999, the share of obese persons was only 10.7&nbsp;% of the population. At that time, the proportion of women (10.2&nbsp;%) affected by obesity was also slightly lower than that of men (11.1&nbsp;%). Thus, the obesity rate among adults has increased and is developing contrary to the goal envisioned by the German Sustainable Development Strategy. Another 33.9&nbsp;% of the population aged 18 and over had a BMI of 25 to under 30 in 2017. In total, 48.5&nbsp;% were considered to be overweight (BMI 25 and over). The proportion of women (38.7&nbsp;%) was significantly smaller than that of men (57.7&nbsp;%).<br><br><br><br>The proportion of adults suffering from obesity increases with age, and the trend reverses only among people at a very advanced age. In 2017, 3.4&nbsp;% of 18 and 19-year-old women were obese. At the age of 30 to under 35, 10.1&nbsp;% of the women were obese. The highest proportion of obese women (21.7&nbsp;%) was found in the age group between 60 and under 65 years of age. The rate of obesity among men was higher among those under 75 than among women of the same age and reached the highest proportions in the age groups 60 to under 65 (24.5&nbsp;%) and 65 to under 70 (25.3&nbsp;%). It is interesting to note that the proportion of obese women is higher than the proportion of obese men at older ages – above about 75 years of age. At this age, however, the proportion of men in the population is also considerably lower. As of 31 December 2017, the proportion of men aged 75 and over in the population at this age was only 40&nbsp;%, while the gender distribution between 50 and 60 years was balanced. This imbalance in old age can be attributed to the higher life expectancy of women or to the fact that men die earlier than women.<br><br><br><br>Being underweight, i. e. having a BMI lower than 18.5, is the opposite phenomenon to that of obesity. In 2017, the share of women who were underweight (4.0&nbsp;%) was considerably greater than the share found in men (1.0&nbsp;%). In fact, 12.1&nbsp;% of young women between 18 and 19 years of age were underweight, and 8.5&nbsp;% were still underweight at an age from 20 to under 25.
