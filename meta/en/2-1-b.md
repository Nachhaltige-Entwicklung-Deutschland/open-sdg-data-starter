national_indicator_available: Organic farming        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents the organically farmed area of agricultural holdings subject to the control procedure of <abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr> legislation on organic farming (Regulation [EC] No. 848/2018&nbsp;and implementing provisions) as a proportion of the total farmed area in Germany (in per cent). This includes both areas that have been fully converted to organic farming and those that are still in the process of conversion.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: The indicator is based on the assumption that organic farming conserves and protects natural resources to a particularly high degree. It has a variety of positive effects on nature, the climate and the environment and serves to produce high-quality food.        

political_target: Increase the proportion of organically farmed agricultural land to 30&nbsp;per cent by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value        

data_state: 15.01.2025        

indicator_name: Organic farming        
section: Farming        
postulate: Environmentally sound production in our cultivated landscapes

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #dda63a; font-size: large">2.1.b Organic farming</b><br><br>Data on organic farming is provided both by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (<abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr>), on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity (BMLEH), and by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>To determine the area under organic cultivation, the Federal Statistical Office uses various surveys. In years when a structural survey is conducted (Agricultural Census or Farm Structure Survey), data on organically farmed areas is collected via primary statistical methods. In the intervening years, an estimation procedure is employed. In the future, data on organically farmed land is to be collected via secondary statistical methods as part of the survey on land use in agricultural holdings&nbsp;–&nbsp;the successor instrument to the main land use survey.<br><br>The reference value for calculating the share of organically farmed land is the utilised agricultural area (UAA), which is recorded annually by the Federal Statistical Office. This comprises all land used for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Farm buildings and farmyard areas are not included in this reference value.<br><br>The <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data contains information on organically farmed land reported annually by the organic control authorities of the federal states. The reference date is 31&nbsp;December of each year. All reports submitted during a calendar year are aggregated up to this reference date. <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data tends to show slightly higher values. This is partly due to the fact that areas without a minimum size threshold are included in the numerator, while the denominator only includes land above a defined threshold. Additionally, differing reporting periods are applied. Consequently, very small areas may be counted in the numerator, whereas only larger areas are included in the denominator.<br><br>According to the data from the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed land in the total utilised agricultural area rose from 2.9% in 1999&nbsp;to 11.2% in 2023. In 2023, this corresponded to 1.85&nbsp;million hectares. The <abbr title="Federal Office for Agriculture and Food" tabindex="0">BLE</abbr> data shows a slightly higher share of organically farmed land, reporting 11.4% or 1.89&nbsp;million hectares for 2023.<br><br>Based on figures from the Federal Statistical Office and extrapolating the trend observed over the past six reporting years, the share of organically farmed land would reach 16.7% by 2030. This would mean that the politically established target of managing 30% of the agricultural area organically by then would not be met, nor would the previous target of 20% set by the federal government.<br><br>In 2023, organic farmland in Germany was used as follows: 51.5% was permanent grassland, 47.0% arable land, and 1.5% other land. In contrast, the focus of agriculture as a whole was on arable land, which accounted for 70.4% of the utilised agricultural area. The share of permanent grassland was 28.4%, while other land made up 1.2% of the total.</p>'

target_description: The proportion of organically farmed agricultural land is to be increased to at least 30&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br>Based on the target formulation, indicator 2.1.b shows a continuous development in the desired direction. If this trend were to continue, the politically defined target would still be missed by a wide margin, meaning that indicator 2.1.b for 2023&nbsp;is rated as "cloud"’.
