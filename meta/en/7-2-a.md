#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator expresses the generation of renewable energies relative to gross final energy consumption. Gross final energy consumption covers energy consumption by end consumers and transmission losses as well as the self-consumption of the energy generation sector.    

dns_indicator_intention: The reserves of fossil fuels such as oil and gas are limited, and their use is associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Switching to renewable energies (natural energy sources that constantly regenerate) serves to reduce energy-related emissions and hence the extent of climate change. In addition, dependency on energy imports and the consumption of resources is reduced as well as technical innovations are promoted. For this reason, the goal of the Federal Government is to increase the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption to 18&nbsp;% by 2020, to 30&nbsp;% by 2030 and to 60&nbsp;% by 2050

postulate: Strengthening a sustainable energy supply    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>For this indicator, the energy generated from renewable sources (including hydropower, wind power on land and at sea, solar energy and geothermal energy, biomass or biogenic waste) is expressed relative to all energy sources consumed in Germany. In addition to renewable energy, this also includes imported electricity and fossil fuels such as lignite and hard coal, oil and gas. Another characteristic of the indicator is that energy consumption is taken into account in all areas of application. This includes its use in the form of mechanical energy, as electric power, heat or fuel in the transport sector.<br><br><br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energies Statistics (AGEE-Stat), but without taking into account the calculation rules pursuant to the EU Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC), which applies an average value across several years for hydropower and wind power due to their annually varying supply. Instead, the actually generated electricity quantities (of wind power and hydropower) are taken into account for this report (energy concept of the Federal Government).<br><br><br><br>Concerning the methodology for calculating the indicator, it should be noted that imports and exports of electricity are not fully included in the final energy consumption of renewable energy sources, whereas they are included in the gross final energy consumption. In this respect, the indicator can over- or underestimate the share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption depending on the foreign trade balance. A positive net export balance of electricity – as has been the case since 2001 – would thus mean that the actual share of renewable energies would be lower than shown by the indicator.<br><br><br><br>Between 1990 and 2017, the share of renewable energy in final gross energy consumption rose from 2.0&nbsp;% to 15.6&nbsp;%. If the trend continues at the average pace seen in the past few years, the goal for 2020 will not be achieved. The use of renewable energies varies significantly depending on the sector. 51.6&nbsp;% of the total energy produced from renewable energies in 2017 was used for electricity generation, 40.2&nbsp;% for heat generation and 8.2&nbsp;% for biogenic fuels. Biomass with a share of 54.5&nbsp;% and wind power with a share of 25.2&nbsp;% of all renewable sources played the most important role as energy sources.<br><br><br><br>The indicator has cross-references to indicators 3.2.a “Emissions of air pollutants”, 7.2.b “Share of electricity from renewable energy sources in electricity consumption” and 13.1.a “Greenhouse gas emissions”.
