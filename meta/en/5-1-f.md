national_indicator_available: Vocational qualification of women and girls through German development assistance        

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the number of women and girls in developing and emerging countries who were reached by vocational qualification measures through German development cooperation. The indicator is divided into financial (<abbr title="financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FZ</abbr>) and technical cooperation (<abbr title="technical cooperation" tabindex="0">TZ</abbr>).<br>Services from <abbr title="technical cooperation" tabindex="0">TZ</abbr> include consulting, to a limited degree the delivery of material goods, the production of facilities and the implementation of studies and reports. <abbr title="financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FZ</abbr> provides favourable loans, venture capital or grants, that do not have to be repaid.        

dns_indicator_intention: The economic participation of girls and women in developing and emerging countries is to be increased. To this end, the number of girls and women in developing and emerging countries who obtain vocational qualifications through German development cooperation is to be gradually increased by one third over the period from 2015&nbsp;to 2030. The Federal Government as part of the G7&nbsp;summit is obliged to support girl’s and women’s education since 2015.        

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">indicator report 2022</a>.

content_and_progress: '<p style="opacity: 0.5"><b>Text from the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Information provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development on supported projects that entered the implementation phase in the respective year served as a data source. The measures taken into account include all short-, medium- and long-term formal and non-formal vocational training measures in developing and emerging countries. The measures are financed entirely by funds from the federal budget and from market funds. The data was collected for the first time in 2015&nbsp;on behalf of the Ministry of Development by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title="German Agency for International Cooperation" tabindex="0">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title="Company with limited liability" tabindex="0">GmbH</abbr> and Centrum für Evaluation <abbr title="Company with limited liability" tabindex="0">GmbH</abbr> (CeVal <abbr title="Company with limited liability" tabindex="0">GmbH</abbr>). The survey was renewed in 2018. From 2021&nbsp;on, the data will be derived every three years from the aggregated results reporting provided by <abbr title="German Agency for International Cooperation" tabindex="0">GIZ</abbr> and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (<abbr title="Reconstruction Loan Corporation" tabindex="0">KfW</abbr>).<br><br>In 2015&nbsp;and 2018, 355,000&nbsp;and 863,000&nbsp;women and girls were reached by skill development measures, respectively. The high number of supported women and girls in 2018&nbsp;was predominantly due to the collaboration with China. Expired collaboration in the education section with China caused a decline to 80,000&nbsp;girls and women, who were reached by skill development measures in 2021. Only a fifth of women and girls were reached by German vocational qualification measures in developing and emerging countries compared to the first year of survey in 2015. However, the indicator does not provide any information on the success, scope and quality of the qualification measures.<br><br>Of the 80,000&nbsp;women and girls, about 79.3&nbsp;% were reached by <abbr title="technical cooperation" tabindex="0">TZ</abbr> and, accordingly, 20.7&nbsp;% by <abbr title="financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FZ</abbr>. While the number of women and girls are recorded ex-post for <abbr title="technical cooperation" tabindex="0">TZ</abbr> measures, the number for <abbr title="financial cooperation" tabindex="0">FZ</abbr> has to be estimated in advance. As a consequence, latter is prone to overestimation and multiple counting.</p>'
