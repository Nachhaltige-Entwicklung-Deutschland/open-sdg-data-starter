national_indicator_available: Official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income        

dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator represents public development expenditure in relation to gross national income, the so-called <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> ratio (in per cent). This comprises the share of official development assistance (<abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr>) in relation to gross national income (<abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr>). Since 2018, the calculation has been based on the grant equivalent method.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Through their development cooperation, donors contribute to reducing global poverty, alleviating humanitarian emergencies, securing peace, realising democracy, making globalisation fair and protecting the environment. In order to fulfil this responsibility, the German government is committed to the goal originally set by the United Nations General Assembly (<abbr title="United Nations" tabindex="0">UN</abbr>) in 1970&nbsp;of increasing the share of official development assistance (<abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr>) in gross national income (<abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr>) (<abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> ratio) to 0.7&nbsp;percent.        

political_target: Increase the proportion to 0.7&nbsp;per cent of gross national income (<abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr>) by 2030        

type_target: Goal with a specific target value

Whether an expenditure can be classified as <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> is governed by the directives of the Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title="Development Assistance Committee" tabindex="0">DAC</abbr>) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr>).<br><br><abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> includes public flows provided on concessional terms with the primary objective of promoting the economic and social development of developing countries. This includes, in particular, expenditure for financial and technical cooperation, humanitarian assistance, as well as contributions to development cooperation activities of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations" tabindex="0">UN</abbr>), the European Union (<abbr title="European Union" tabindex="0">EU</abbr>), the World Bank Group, or regional development banks.<br><br>In addition, under certain conditions, expenditures for peace missions, debt relief, or specific in-donor country costs&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as tuition costs for students from developing countries, in-country refugee costs, or spending on development-related research&nbsp;–&nbsp;may also be recognised as <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr>.<br><br>Gross National Income (<abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr>) is a measure of the primary distribution of income generated by the economic activities of all residents before government redistribution through taxes, social contributions, and transfers. <abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr> captures all income of residents and resident economic entities, regardless of whether the income is generated domestically or from abroad. This is the key distinction from Gross Domestic Product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>), which is based on the location of production and thus follows the domestic production principle.<br><br>The list of countries eligible to receive <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> is determined by the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr>-DAC. It includes the Least Developed Countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) as well as other countries with low and middle per capita <abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr>. This list is regularly reviewed and updated; countries may be added or removed.<br><br>In 2018, the valuation method for debt instruments (loans, bonds, and debt relief) was revised: the previous net disbursement approach was replaced by the grant equivalent method. Under this method, only the grant element of an instrument&nbsp;–&nbsp;calculated based on factors such as interest rate and maturity&nbsp;–&nbsp;is counted as <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr>. One objective of this change is to enhance the comparability of loans and grants. Since 2020, the grant equivalent method has also applied to debt cancellations and reschedulings, and since 2023, to equity investments.<br><br>According to preliminary results, German <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> in 2024&nbsp;amounted to 32.4&nbsp;billion euros, which was below the 2023&nbsp;figure of 35.1&nbsp;billion euros. The share of <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> in Germany’s <abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr> in 2024&nbsp;stood at 0.67&nbsp;% (2023: 0.82&nbsp;%). The politically set target of 0.70&nbsp;% was exceeded in the years 2020&nbsp;to 2023, but slightly underachieved in 2024.<br><br>While <abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr> has more than doubled since 2010, <abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr> has more than tripled over the same period.<br><br>In international comparison, Germany was again the second-largest donor in absolute terms in 2024&nbsp;–&nbsp;behind the United States and ahead of Japan. However, the <abbr title="United States" tabindex="0">US</abbr> ODA-to-<abbr title="Gross national income" tabindex="0">GNI</abbr> ratio stood at 0.22&nbsp;%, which was below the <abbr title="Development Assistance Committee" tabindex="0">DAC</abbr> average of 0.33&nbsp;%. Germany ranked fifth among the 32&nbsp;<abbr title="Development Assistance Committee" tabindex="0">DAC</abbr> member countries with a ratio of 0.67&nbsp;%.<br><br>According to preliminary figures, the international target of 0.70&nbsp;% was achieved in 2024&nbsp;by the <abbr title="Development Assistance Committee" tabindex="0">DAC</abbr> countries Norway (1.02&nbsp;%), Luxembourg (1.00&nbsp;%), Sweden (0.79&nbsp;%), and Denmark (0.71&nbsp;%).<br><br>In addition to public development cooperation, private actors&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as churches, foundations, and associations&nbsp;–&nbsp;also deploy own resources for development purposes. These include own funds (including membership fees) as well as donations. This private, non-<abbr title="Official development assistance" tabindex="0">ODA</abbr>-relevant development cooperation amounted to 1.5&nbsp;billion euros in 2023. Private direct investments in developing countries stood at 18.4&nbsp;billion euros in 2023&nbsp;(according to the status prior to Bundesbank revision).</p>'

target_description: The share of public development expenditure in gross national income is to be increased to at least 0.7&nbsp;per cent by 2030.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, the politically defined target value of indicator 17.1&nbsp;was exceeded for the first time in 2021. Since then, the aim has been to maintain the target value every year and to show no deterioration on average over the last six years. Both of these requirements were met in 2024, meaning that indicator 17.1&nbsp;is rated as "Sun" for 2024.
