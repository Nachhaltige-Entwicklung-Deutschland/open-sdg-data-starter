#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Gross fixed capital formation in relation to GDP    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of gross fixed capital formation relative to nominal gross domestic product (which means at current prices). This share is also referred to as the investment ratio.    

dns_indicator_intention: Future investments made by both the private and public sectors are decisive in creating a strong and competitive economy. For this reason, the goal of the Federal Government is to promote appropriate development of the share of gross fixed capital formation in gross domestic product (GDP).    

indicator_name: Gross fixed capital formation in relation to GDP    
section: Provision for future economic stability    
postulate: Creating favourable investment conditions – Securing long-term prosperity    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The level of gross fixed capital formation is determined by the Federal Statistical Office. It includes additions (that is, acquisitions less disposals without taking into account consumption of fixed capital) of fixed assets by resident economic units. Fixed assets are produced assets that are designed for repeated or continuous use in production processes for longer than a year. These include buildings and structures (dwellings, other buildings and structures), machinery and equipment (machinery, vehicles, tools), weapons systems and other assets (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, computer software and databases, entertainment, literary or artistic originals, mineral exploration and evaluation as well as animal resources and tree, crop and plant resources). Also included are improvements on existing stocks of fixed assets that lead to a significant increase in the value of an asset and/or prolong its useful life.<br><br><br><br>Gross fixed capital formation is determined as part of national accounts, which are compiled in accordance with harmonised European rules and based on all available, relevant data sources.<br><br><br><br>In 2017, the share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP was 20.3&nbsp;% and was thus 4.5 percentage points below the initial value in 1991 for the entire federal territory as well as 2.7&nbsp;% percentage points lower than in 2000. The indicator has moved into the desired direction both in the short and medium term; however, it has been largely stagnating since 2002. The share would be almost unchanged (19.5&nbsp;%) on a price-adjusted basis compared with 2010. The investment ratio in Germany was an annual average of 19.9&nbsp;% between 2007 and 2016, which was below the investment ratio for the entire OECD region (20.9&nbsp;%). The difference has been considerably smaller since 2010 than in the period between 2003 and 2008 (– 2.9 percentage points).<br><br><br><br>Looking at the time series reveals a wavelike trend in the investment ratio that is marked by declines at the start of the millennium and, following a slight recovery, again in 2009 after the financial market and economic crisis of 2008/2009. Up to 2011, investment activity recovered, and gross fixed capital formation once again exceeded the level of the pre-crisis year. Between 2014 and 2017, gross fixed capital formation grew strongly by 13.3&nbsp;% in total and reached a level of 666 billion euros. Since the increase in nominal GDP in the same period was slightly lower (11.5&nbsp;%), the investment ratio increased slightly from 20.0 to 20.3&nbsp;% and reached the level of 2008 and 2011.<br><br><br><br>With regard to gross fixed capital formation in construction, the dwellings sector has recorded strong nominal growth (+48.8&nbsp;%) since 2010, while the growth of gross fixed capital formation in other buildings and structures (both in building construction and underground construction) in the same period was less pronounced (+23.5&nbsp;%) and even slightly declined in 2012 and 2015. Gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment at current prices increased most recently by 2.6&nbsp;% (2016) and 4.2&nbsp;% (2017) compared to the previous year and – despite the sharp decline in 2009 (– 22.0&nbsp;%) – surpassed the pre-crisis level of 2008. The strongest growth since 1991 was recorded for gross fixed capital formation in research and development as well as in computer software and databases. Between 1991 and 2017 its volume almost tripled.<br><br><br><br>The period from 1991 to 2017 witnessed a strong shift in investment activity from industry to the service sector. In 1991, 30.9&nbsp;% of new fixed capital formation was still being made by enterprises of the industry sector. By 2017, this figure had fallen to just 23.7&nbsp;%. In 2017, 74.9&nbsp;% of fixed capital formation was made in the service branches. In 1991, this figure was still 67.5&nbsp;%. The largest single investment area was that of real estate activities. In 2017 alone, this sector accounted for 31.2&nbsp;% of all new fixed assets. The general government sector, whose investment activities are spread across various sectors of the economy, accounted for 11.0&nbsp;% of gross fixed capital formation in 2017.
