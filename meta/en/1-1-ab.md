#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Material deprivation and severe material deprivation    

dns_indicator_definition: Material deprivation refers to the lack of specific consumer goods and the involuntary foregoing of discretionary consumption for financial reasons. The two indicators indicate the proportion of people out of the total population who are deemed to suffer material deprivation (1.1.a) or severe material deprivation (1.1.b). Material deprivation describes the situation of all people whose household meets at least three (four in the case of severe material deprivation) out of nine defined criteria reflecting the financial restrictions on the household.    

dns_indicator_intention: The material deprivation indicator is also part of the extensive poverty and wealth reporting conducted by the German Government. By identifying individual deficiencies, it is intended to map the types of personal circumstances in which a risk of poverty exists. The aim of the fight against material deprivation is to ensure that the percentages of persons in Germany who are materially deprived and who are severely materially deprived should both be below the average for the European Union.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: "<i>Taken from the official translation of the German Sustainable Development Strategy</i><br><br>The data are drawn from the EU-wide harmonised annual Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the results of a survey conducted in Germany by the Federal Statistical Office in cooperation with the statistical offices of the various Länder under the title “Living in Europe”. This involves some 14,000 private households in Germany, which voluntarily provide information about their income and living conditions annually.<br><br>Both indicators show the percentage of the population who, in their own estimation, involuntarily forego consumption or experience shortages in several areas for financial reasons. Purchases of selected lifestyle items considered in Europe to be appropriate, desirable or even essential were used as evaluation criteria. These nine criteria used to define material deprivation are standardised for all countries in which the EU-SILC survey is conducted, which makes EU-wide comparisons possible.<br><br>Specifically, the nine attributes are as follows: the lack of a car, a washing machine, a colour TV or a telephone in the household (in each case because the household is unable to afford one), a financial problem paying rent, mortgage or utility bills on time, being unable to provide for adequate heating in the home, being unable to eat meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day, not being able to spend a one-week holiday away from home each year or being unable to meet unexpected expenditure of a specific amount (EUR 1,050 in 2018) from the household budget.<br><br>Material deprivation is associated with the problem of social exclusion, because participation in social life is jeopardised by a lack of funds. This measure of severe material deprivation is also part of the “poverty or social exclusion” indicator, which is used to measure progress towards one of the five headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy (combating poverty and social exclusion).<br><br>In 2018, 7.8% of the population in Germany were classed as materially deprived, while 3.1% were subject to severe material deprivation. The corresponding values in 2010 were 11.1% and 4.5% respectively, and they were even slightly higher in some cases in the years immediately following. The level has thus shown a slight fall over time, similar to that in the EU as a whole. The average values for people in the EU, however, are considerably higher on both counts than the corresponding values for Germany. In 2018, for instance, the materially deprived proportion of the EU population, as estimated by the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat), was 13.1%, which is more than half the German figure. A total of 5.9% were classed as severely materially deprived. This quota is 90% higher than the corresponding value in Germany."
