#Metadata                   
national_indicator_available: Materially deprived and severely materially deprived persons                   

dns_indicator_definition: "Material deprivation describes the lack of specific consumer goods and the involuntary foregoing of discretionary consumption for financial reasons. The two indicators represent the proportion of people out of the total population who are deemed to suffer either material deprivation (1.1.a) or severe material deprivation (1.1.b). The designation of (severe) material deprivation applies to all people whose household meets at least three (severely materially deprived: at least four) of nine defined criteria reflecting the financial restrictions of the household."                   

dns_indicator_intention: The indicator “material deprivation” also is part of the extensive reporting on poverty and wealth conducted by the Federal Government. By identifying individual deficiencies, it aims to act as a substitute for illustrating living conditions threatened by poverty. Therefore both, the percentage of persons who are materially as well as severely materially deprived, should stay below the level within the European Union.

#Content                    
content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data are drawn from the Europe-wide harmonised annual Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which in Germany is conducted by the Federal Statistical Office in cooperation with the statistical offices of the various Länder and titled “Living in Europe”. This involves about 14,000 private households in Germany which voluntarily provide information on their income and living conditions annually.<br><br>The indicators show the respective proportion of the population for which according to a self-assessment involuntary foregoing or deficiencies in several areas apply for financial reasons. The selected survey variables are expenditures based on a lifestyle that is considered appropriate, desirable or even necessary in Europe. These nine criteria used to characterise “material deprivation” are standardised across all countries in which EU-SILC is conducted, thereby allowing Europe-wide comparisons.<br><br>Specifically, the nine criteria cover: the lack of a car, a washing machine, a colour TV or a telephone in the household (in each case because the household is unable to afford one); a financial difficulty, paying rent, mortgage or utility bills on time, ensuring adequate heating in the residence, eating meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day, spending one week’s holidays per year outside the actual residence or meeting unplanned expenditures of a specific amount (poverty threshold of the previous year; 2017: 1,000 euros) from one’s own financial resources.<br><br>Material deprivation is associated with the problem of social exclusion because participation in social life is jeopardised by the lack of financial means. The “severe material deprivation” indicator is also part of the “poverty or social exclusion” indicator, which is used to measure one of the five core objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy (combating poverty and social exclusion).<br><br>In 2017, 9.1&nbsp;% of the population in Germany were classified as materially deprived, while 3.4&nbsp;% were affected by severe material deprivation. The corresponding values were 11.1&nbsp;% and 4.5&nbsp;% in 2010 and slightly higher in some subsequent years, resulting in a slight decline over time, similar to the EU as a whole. However, the average values for persons in the EU are significantly higher than the respective values for Germany. For instance, the proportion of the materially deprived EU population in 2017 was 14.7&nbsp;% according to the estimates of the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and was therefore more than 50&nbsp;% higher than in Germany. A total of 6.7&nbsp;% of the EU population were considered as severely materially deprived persons. This rate is 97&nbsp;% higher than the respective value in Germany. However, both the share of materially deprived and that of severely materially deprived people decrease more rapidly in the EU than in Germany. Consequently, it can be expected that the German and the European rates will converge if this development continues."
