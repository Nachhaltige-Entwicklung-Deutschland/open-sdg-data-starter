content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The indicator shows the number of members of the Textiles Partnership. As a multi-stakeholder initiative, the Textiles Partnership consists of members from the following stakeholder groups: businesses, associations, unions, non-governmental organisations, standard organisations 1 and the Federal Government. Building on collectively defined partnership standards, each member commits to implementing measures to continuously improve conditions and meet social and environmental partnership standards throughout its supply chain when joining the Textiles Partnership. To this end, all members are to develop annually individual action plans (roadmaps). Subsequently, an independent body will carry out a plausibility check (logical comparison) on the roadmaps. Since 2017 the drafting of the action plans has been mandatory, as has been their public accessibility since 2018. It is also planned to make the publication of relevant progress reports mandatory as from 2019.<br><br><br><br>In its founding year 2014, 59 members joined the Textiles Partnership. By the end of 2016, the number of members had more than tripled to a high of 188. However, there have been both exclusions and several withdrawals from the Textiles Partnership since the drafting of action plans became mandatory. Members who did not fulfil their reporting obligations were excluded. On the other hand, members withdrew , giving as a reason the amount of effort required or insufficient relevance, so that the number of members at the end of September 2018 totalled 130. Of the original founding members (period from October to November 2014), 34 were still members of the Textiles Partnership by the end of September 2018. The number of members has developed positively on an average of the last four years.<br><br><br><br>At the end of September 2018, 82 of the members were classified in the businesses stakeholder group, although one member was a so-called associate member without a subsidiary in Germany. According to a special evaluation from the Federal Statistical Office’s statistical business register, in 2016, 49 of the 82 companies (59.8&nbsp;%) mainly belonged to the retail and wholesale trade sector, but not consistently to economic sectors with the main field of activity being textiles and clothing. In 2016, these recorded a turnover 2 of 31.5 billion euros in retail and 7.4 billion euros in wholesale trade. According to the trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office, the total turnover of retailers in 2016 amounted to 537.5 billion euros and the total turnover of wholesalers to 1,164.6 billion euros. Enterprises classified under retail trade generated 10.7&nbsp;% of the turnover with clothing, textiles (excluding carpets), curtains and drapes. In wholesale trade, the share of such goods was 2.7&nbsp;%. <br><br><br><br>Another 21 enterprises in the businesses stakeholder group were classified in manufacturing, while 8 were predominantly classified in business or household-related services. According to a special evaluation from the business register of the Federal Statistical Office, these recorded a total turnover of 3.8 billion euros with goods and services. For the economic sectors mentioned above, the turnover cannot be broken down to show the percentage of textiles and clothing."
