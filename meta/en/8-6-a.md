#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Members of the Textiles Partnership    

dns_indicator_definition: "The indicator shows the number of members of the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles (the Textiles Partnership). The Textiles Partnership comprises ordinary, advisory and associate members. The ordinary membership is subdivided into what are known as stakeholder groups: the businesses (initiatives and associations), unions, non-governmental organisations, standards organisations and the German Federal Government. A standards organisation is a body that offers or develops non-commercial standards for sustainable textiles. Membership of the Textiles Partnership is voluntary and is obtained by application."    

dns_indicator_intention: The Partnership for Sustainable Textiles is a multi-stakeholder initiative that was founded in 2014. The Textiles Partnership aims to improve the underlying social, ecological and economic conditions in the producer countries. Membership numbers should therefore be increased significantly by 2030.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Taken from the official translation of the German Sustainable Development Strategy</i><br><br>The indicator shows the number of members of the Textiles Partnership. Being a multi-stakeholder initiative, the Textiles Partnership has more than just business enterprises in its ranks. On the basis of jointly defined Partnership objectives, each company, by joining the Textiles Partnership, pledges to implement measures for continuous improvement of conditions and for compliance with social and environmental objectives of the Partnership throughout the company’s supply chain. To this end, since 2017 all members are bound to draw up individual action plans known as road maps. These road maps are then reviewed for plausibility by an external service provider.<br><br>In its founding year of 2014, 59 members joined the Textiles Partnership. The end of 2016 saw membership reach its peak, having more than trebled to 188. Since the introduction of the compulsory plans of action, however, there have been expulsions and several withdrawals from the Textiles Partnership. On the one hand, some members were expelled for non-fulfilment of their reporting obligations. On the other hand, some members withdrew, citing compliance costs or insufficient relevance, which meant that total membership stood at 124 at the end of December 2019. Of the original founding members that joined in October or November 2014, there were still 30 in the Partnership at the end of December 2019. Over that five-year period there was an overall downward trend in the number of members.<br><br>At the end of December 2019, 75 out of 124 members (60%) were classed as companies; eight of them did not have their registered office in Germany. If a company is a member of the Textiles Partnership, this does not necessarily mean that its main economic activity is in the field of textiles and/or clothing manufacture. According to the statistical business register of the Federal Statistical Office, some 70% of the member companies operated primarily in the manufacture, wholesaling or retailing of textiles and/or clothing in 2019. Their aggregate turnover in 2019 amounted to EUR 17.4 billion. According to the trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office, total retail turnover for the whole of 2018 amounted to EUR 579.6 billion, while total wholesale turnover came to EUR 1,325.6 billion. About 4.8% of these amounts were earned by companies primarily assigned to the wholesale and retail sector through sales of clothing, textiles and curtains, excluding footwear, leather goods and carpets.
