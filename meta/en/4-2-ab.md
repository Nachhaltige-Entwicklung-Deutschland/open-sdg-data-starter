national_indicator_available: All-day care provision for children    

dns_indicator_definition: This indicator shows children in all-day care on the reference date of 1 March as a proportion of all children in the same age group on 31 December of the previous year. All-day childcare is provided for a contractually agreed, continuous care period of more than seven hours per day; day care in private homes and care of pupils are not included. Indicator 4.2.a refers to the group of 0 to 2-year-old children, indicator 4.2.b to the group of 3 to 5-year-old children.    

dns_indicator_intention: The proportion of 0 to 2-year-old children attending all-day care is to reach at least 35&nbsp;% (4.2.a) by 2030. For 3 to 5-year-olds (4.2.b), the proportion is to increase to at least 60&nbsp;% by 2020 and to at least 70&nbsp;% by 2030. An increase in the proportion of children attending all-day care is desirable because the availability of childcare options that meet the needs of today’s families improve the compatibility of family life and work. They also make an important contribution to equal opportunities, gender equality and integration.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The information of the indicator is provided by the annual statistics on children cared for and persons employed in day care centres, which is compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. The indicators show the proportion of children for whom daily childcare of more than seven hours has been arranged, which may deviate from the actual time spent in childcare. Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can also improve the compatibility of work and family life, and other types of care, e.g. day care in private homes, are not included. Furthermore, information on childcare services aimed at children aged 6 years and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is included, for example, in the data of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last paragraph).<br><br><br><br>In 2018, all-day care in day care centres was arranged for 45.9&nbsp;% of the 3 to 5-year-old children (kindergarten age). For children under 3 years of age (nursery age) this figure was 16.5&nbsp;%. As a result, children in all-day care as a proportion of all 3 to 5-year-olds has increased by just under 24 percentage points since 2006 and has therefore more than doubled. The full-day care of children below the age of 3 rose by 10.6 percentage points from 2006 to 2018 and has thus almost tripled. Overall, both indicators are developing in the intended direction, with indicator 4.2.b being closer to the target value than indicator 4.2.a.<br><br><br><br>The total number of children under six years of age receiving all-day care in day care centres in 2018 was 1.4 million; the number of children in part-time care was 1.3 million. Another 61,000 children under six years of age were cared for in private homes by publicly supported childminders. In addition to that, some of the 5-year-olds go to school already.<br><br><br><br>More than a quarter of the children cared for in day care centres or by publicly supported childminding services had a migrant background, meaning that at least one of the parents was of foreign origin. 50&nbsp;% of these children were in day care in 2018, compared with 69&nbsp;% of the children without a migrant background.<br><br><br><br> With regard to the availability of all-day care provided by facilities, there is a clear gap between the Länder in the east and the Länder in the west of Germany. The highest percentages of 0 to 2-year-olds in all-day care are recorded in the eastern Länder and in Berlin. The values range from 49.2&nbsp;% in Thuringia to 9.7&nbsp;% in Baden-Württemberg. For 3 to 5-year-olds, the percentage was also highest in Thuringia at 91.8&nbsp;% and lowest in Baden-Württemberg at 24.5&nbsp;% (each 2018).<br><br><br><br>When it comes to opportunities of care for pupils, pre and after-school care programmes and all-day schools also play a significant role. In 2018, 19,000 children between 5 and 13 years of age were looked after on an all-day basis in care programmes and 483,200 children part-time (lessons are not regarded as childcare). The percentage of pupils attending all-day schools of all pupils in schools of general education was 42.5&nbsp;% in the 2016/2017 school year. However, this figure includes pupils from all school types and hence includes also pupils who are older than 13 years. In primary schools, 40.1&nbsp;% of children received all-day care in that school year. In comparison to 2006, the number of all-day school pupils has increased considerably, from almost 1.5 million to 3.1 million (in all schools of general education) and from 400,000 to 1.1 million in the primary schools.
