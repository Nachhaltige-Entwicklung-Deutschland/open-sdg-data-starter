#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Accessibility of medium-sized and large cities by public transport    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the population-weighted average travel time by public transport to the nearest medium-sized or large city.    

dns_indicator_intention: Mobility is a key factor in enabling people’s social participation. Accordingly, spatial develop-ment and transportation should be designed to provide good mobility services and suitable connections to medium-sized or large cities for the entire population. Therefore, the target of the Federal Government is to shorten the average travel time by public transport to the nearest medium-sized or large city.

postulate: Guaranteeing mobility – Protecting the environment

content_and_progress: "<i>Text from the Indicator Report 2020</i><br><br>The indicator is computed by the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. Means of public transport are defined as those transport services that can be used by anyone on payment of the relevant fees. Flexible forms of operation, such as on-call buses that operate on demand without fixed stopping points and timetables, are therefore not taken into account.<br><br><br><br>The data basis comprises schedule data of the Deutsche Bahn, transport associations along with numerous other timetables. With the help of the timetable data, the travel times to the nearest medium-sized or large city during peak morning traffic times were determined for approximately 250,000 stops. This time period is defined differently in the two reference years. Whereas connections with an arrival time between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. were taken into account in 2012, only those with arrival times between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon were included in 2016.<br><br><br><br>Since not all local transport schedules were fully integrated into the database used, the values for 2012 and 2016 are not fully comparable. The frequency of a transport service to the nearest medium-sized or large city is similarly disregarded as is the travel time to and from the stop. Furthermore, this indicator is based on the timetable data – which means that delays or even cancellations are not taken into account.<br><br><br><br>The classification of a location as a medium-sized or large city is determined according to the availability of goods, services and infrastructure at that location that are not available in the surrounding smaller places. These include, among other things, specialist medical practices, hospitals, cultural facilities as well as secondary schools and institutions of higher education.<br><br><br><br>In each medium-sized or large city, especially in major cities, only one destination point (city centre) was determined. The destination stops were selected within a radius of one kilometre around the destination point, and the fastest connection from the starting stop to the destination was searched for. With the help of small-area population data from the Federal Statistical Office, a population-weighted average value of the travel time for Germany was then determined.<br><br><br><br>The indicator is related to the United Nations indicator 11.2.1 “Access to public transport”. Germany reports, based on data from the German Mobility Panel, the proportion of the population living within ten minutes of a public stop. Based on these data, around 94&nbsp;% of the population had access to public transport in 2017.<br><br><br><br>The indicator values available for 2012 and 2016 show that the population-weighted average travel time to the nearest medium-sized or large city has declined from 23.5 to 22.4 minutes during this period. This corresponds to a reduction of 4.7&nbsp;%. It is not possible to determine the extent to which the previously described methodological changes or re-designation of medium-sized cities are also responsible for the decrease. However, the number of medium-sized or large cities increased from 1,010 in 2012 to 1,069."
