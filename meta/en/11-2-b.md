national_indicator_available: Final energy consumption in passenger transport    

dns_indicator_definition: Final energy consumption in passenger transport represents the energy consumption for the carriage of people within Germany by rail, by air and by road (public and private transport).    

dns_indicator_intention: Traffic creates a range of challenges. For instance, noise and air pollutants impair the quality of life especially in cities, and traffic-related emissions contribute to climate change. The emission of harmful greenhouse gases is linked to the energy consumed for transport purposes. Therefore, final energy consumption in passenger transport is to be reduced by 15 to 20&nbsp;% by 2030.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2021</i><br><br>The data regarding domestic final energy consumption originate from the Transport Emission Model (TREMOD) database at the ifeu (German Institute for Energy and Environmental Research). TREMOD is a model for evaluating traffic emissions. The data include fuel consumption levels associated with passenger transport within Germany according to the consumption concept, that is, irrespective of where fuelling takes place. “Final energy” refers to the part of the energy used directly during transportation, so this excludes conversion losses that arise during production of fuels as well as possible pipeline losses.<br><br><br><br>Passenger transport performance specifies the number of passenger-kilometres covered. It is used to calculate the specific energy consumption in this sector and is computed by the ifeu on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. For air transport, only domestic flights (national aviation) are taken into account. International flights to and from the federal territory are not included. The carriage of passengers by ship is not included, either.<br><br><br><br>Nearly 30&nbsp;% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity (distance per road/rail or air passenger numbers) changes. In addition to final energy consumption, energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured as energy consumption per passenger-kilometre, is examined.<br><br><br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 1.1&nbsp;% in the period from 2005 to 2016. Analysis of the progress since 2008 reveals that the indicator value increased by 1.7&nbsp;%. Thus final energy consumption in passenger transport is currently developing in a direction which opposes the goal of the German Sustainability Strategy.<br><br><br><br>Although the number of passenger-kilometres covered increased by 10.5&nbsp;% between 2005 and 2016, energy consumption in all forms of transport decreased by 10.5&nbsp;% to 1.43 megajoules per passenger-kilometre during the same period. Consequently, efficiency in passenger transport increased notably. A particularly large share of the efficiency increase can be attributed torail transport. Here, transport performance increased by 24.7&nbsp;%, while final energy consumption was successfully reduced by 11.2&nbsp;%. This was a 28.8&nbsp;% increase in efficiency. A considerable increase in efficiency of 13.9&nbsp;% was also achieved in air transport compared to 2005. A slight improvement in the efficiency of private motorised transport was recently achieved due to an increased transport performance, eventhough energy consumption remained constant.<br><br><br><br>Private motorised transport by car and two-wheel vehicles accounted for 83.7&nbsp;% of total passenger transport performance in 2015. In 2016 it was 83.6%. This mode of transport can be subdivided into different categories. In 2015 (more recent data were not yet available), transport for recreational purposes accounted for the largest share (35.4&nbsp;%), closely followed by work-related transport (commuting and business trips) with 34.5&nbsp;%. Transport for shopping purposes accounted for 17.5%. The various transport purposes have developed differently since 2005. In particular, the proportion of work-related journeys has increased considerably (+ 15.6&nbsp;%), while holiday journeys have declined (– 1.6&nbsp;%).
