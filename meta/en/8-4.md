In 2024, it amounted to 42,583&nbsp;euros per capita, which was 0.5&nbsp;% below the previous year's value. Between 1991&nbsp;and 2024, the inflation-adjusted <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> per capita increased by a total of 40.0&nbsp;%.<br><br>In 2020, the <abbr title='Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2' tabindex='0'>COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic caused a decline in the inflation-adjusted <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> per capita of 4.2&nbsp;%. An even sharper drop occurred only in 2009, as a result of the global financial and economic crisis, with a decrease of 5.2&nbsp;%.<br><br>Due to the lack of a uniform definition of adequate and sustained economic growth, only the average annual change over the last five years can be used as a reference. This was 0.3&nbsp;% and thus indicates a long-term negative trend of the indicator.<br><br>At the level of the Bundesländer, the picture in 2023&nbsp;was as follows: Sachsen-Anhalt recorded the lowest real <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> per capita at 27,163&nbsp;euros, while Hamburg recorded the highest at 61,590&nbsp;euros.<br><br><b>Background on the Calculation</b><br><br><abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> measures the total economic output produced within a country during a reporting period. It includes both market-traded and government-provided goods and services. Residents are defined as all persons who have their permanent place of residence in Germany.<br><br>The calculation is based on the European System of National and Regional Accounts (<abbr title='European System of National and Regional Accounts' tabindex='0'>ESA</abbr>), which mandates the concepts and methods of the national accounts (<abbr title='National accounts' tabindex='0'>VGR</abbr>). The national accounts constitute an integrated accounting framework representing economic activity over a specific period. The results are consistently determined within a closed accounting system and presented in tabular form. <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> is the central indicator of the national accounts.<br><br>The population figures used for calculating the indicator are the average population numbers, extrapolated and updated from the 2011&nbsp;census by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br><b>Limitations of GDP</b><br><br><abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> primarily functions as a production and income indicator. For a comprehensive measure of welfare, supplementary indicators are necessary, such as those from the Environmental Economic Accounts (<abbr title='Environmental economic accounts' tabindex='0'>UGR</abbr>), which represent interactions between the economy and the environment. As a single figure, <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> naturally does not provide information about the distribution of income and wealth among different population groups.<br><br>Changes in stock variables&nbsp;–&nbsp;with the exception of the capital stock, which is accounted for through investments and depreciation&nbsp;–&nbsp;are not captured in <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr>. Key economic variables such as the stocks and quality of human capital (e.g., education, health), social capital (e.g., security, integration), and natural capital (e.g., resources, ecosystems) are also excluded from <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr>.<br><br>Therefore, it is not possible to assess whether <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr> growth has contributed to capital maintenance in a comprehensive sense. Accordingly, no direct conclusions about the sustainability of economic growth can be drawn from <abbr title='Gross domestic product' tabindex='0'>GDP</abbr>.</p>"
