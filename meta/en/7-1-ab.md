#Metadata    
national_indicator_available: Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption    

dns_indicator_definition: The final energy productivity indicator shows the trend of value added for each unit of final energy used. “Final energy” refers to the part of the energy that is available as thermal or electrical energy for the manufacture of goods or for use by households.<br><br>The primary energy consumption indicator shows how much energy has been consumed in a country, on the one hand for transformation by the energy industries and on the other hand in industry, households and transport.    

dns_indicator_intention: After the promotion of renewable energies, the reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency is the second pillar of the energy transition. The aim is to achieve a high level of economic output while using as little energy as possible. Energy saving protects the climate and the environment and helps to improve the security of supply and industrial competitiveness.<br><br>According to the German Government’s energy blueprint, final energy productivity is to be increased by 2.1% annually from 2008 to 2050. At the same time, primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20% from its 2008 level by 2020, 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2021 is as of 31.12.2020. The data shown on the DNS-Online-Platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the indicator report 2021.    

indicator_name: Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption    
section: Resource conservation    
postulate: Using resources economically and efficiently    

#Content    
content_and_progress: <i>Taken from the official translation of the German Sustainable Development Strategy</i><br><br>Final energy consumption and primary energy consumption are directly related to one another. Final energy consumption is primary energy consumption less total losses from transformation, flaring and distribution and the statistical difference.<br><br>Primary energy consumption is the sum of domestically extracted primary energy sources, use of stocks and all imported energy sources minus storage, energy exports and marine bunkers. The main basis for the calculation of energy consumption comprises the data on energy balances from the Energy Balance Association (AGEB), which are supplemented with data from other sources.<br><br>Final energy productivity means how much added value accrues from each unit of final energy used. It constitutes a measurement of energy efficiency in the production of goods and in household energy use. However, estimates of energy efficiency in the transformation process (plant efficiency) or in the transmission of energy (elimination of leakages, improved heat insulation, etc.) cannot be directly inferred from the indicator.<br><br>According to provisional findings, final energy productivity in the period from 2008 to 2019 increased by 15.4%, which equates to an average annual increase of about 1.4%. This means that the goal of an annual increase of 2.1% on average up to 2050 is not yet being achieved. In 2019, energy productivity showed a slight year-on-year decline of 0.6 percentage points.<br><br>Primary energy consumption registered a year-on-year decline in 2019. Provisional findings indicate that primary energy consumption fell by 11.1% in the period from 2008 to 2019. Accordingly, if the trend of past years were to remain unchanged, the target value for 2020 would not be achieved.
