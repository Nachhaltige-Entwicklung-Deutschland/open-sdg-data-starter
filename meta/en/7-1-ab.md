national_indicator_available: Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator “Final energy productivity” shows the trend of value added per unit of final energy used. The concept of “final energy” refers to the part of the energy that is used energetically in terms of thermal or electric energy in the production sectors for the manufacturing of goods or by households. The indicator ”primary energy consumption” specifies how much energy was consumed by a country in the energy sectors for conversion purposes on the one hand, and by production activities, transport and households on the other.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Along with the expansion of renewable energies, the reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency represents the second supporting pillar of the energy transition. The goal is to achieve a high level of economic output while using as little energy as possible. Saving energy protects the climate and the environment, it helps to improve the security of supply and the industrial competitiveness. According to the Federal Government’s energy concept, final energy productivity is to be increased by 2.1&nbsp;% annually in the period 2008 to 2050. At the same time, primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20&nbsp;% by 2020 and by 50&nbsp;% by 2050, both compared with 2008. These targets are also used here as a basis.

#Content                    
content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>Final energy and primary energy consumption are directly related to one another. Final energy consumption is derived from the sum of primary energy consumption, conversion, flare and transmission losses as well as the statistical difference.<br><br>Primary energy consumption is the sum of domestically extracted primary fuels, withdrawals from reserves and all imported fuels minus storage, energy exports and marine bunkers. A key component in the calculation of energy consumption is the data from the energy balances of the AGEB (Energy Balance Association), which are supplemented with data from other sources.<br><br>Final energy productivity indicates the amount of value added created by each unit of final energy used. It represents a measurement of energy efficiency in production areas and in the energy use of households. However, estimates of energy efficiency in the areas of conversion (efficiency of power stations) or in the transmission of energy and storage (elimination of breaches, improved heat insulation, etc.) cannot be directly derived from the indicator.<br><br>According to preliminary results, final energy productivity in the period 2008 to 2017 increased by 9.6&nbsp;%, equating to an average annual increase of 1.0&nbsp;%. This means that the goal of an annual increase of 2.1&nbsp;% on average up to 2050 has not yet been achieved. In the year-on-year comparison, energy productivity for 2017 has even fallen by 0.9 percentage points. The reason for this was that the final energy consumption in every sector except households (+2.2&nbsp;% on the previous year) increased proportionally faster than the gross domestic product. In particular, at a rate of change of around 3.9&nbsp;% in 2017, final energy consumption in the industrial sector was far above the price-adjusted growth rate of the gross domestic product (2.2&nbsp;%). If final energy consumption grows faster than the gross domestic product, final energy productivity decreases.<br><br>Primary energy consumption rose slightly in 2017, which can be partially attributed to slightly cooler weather conditions and to growth in the economy. Although primary energy consumption was lower than in 1990, it increased slightly compared with the previous year. Provisional results indicate that primary energy consumption fell by 5.5&nbsp;% in the period from 2008 to 2017. If development remains the same as in the previous years, the target value for 2020 will not be achieved.
