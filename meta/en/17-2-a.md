#Metadata                   
national_indicator_available: Students and researchers from developing and emerging countries in Germany                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator records the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries per year or semester. Here, the number of students and researchers from the least developed countries (LDCs) is listed separately.                   

dns_indicator_intention: Knowledge is a key driver of sustainable development not only at national level but also in global terms. The strengthening of the international exchange of knowledge by Germany is an important measure in this context. For this reason, the target of the Federal Government is to increase the total number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10&nbsp;% from 2015 until 2020 and to stabilise the number at the same level thereafter.                   

indicator_name: Number of students and researchers from developing countries and LDCs per year                   
section: Knowledge transfer, especially in technical areas                   
postulate: Sharing knowledge internationally

content_and_progress: <i>Text from the Indicator Report 2018</i><br><br>The data basis of the indicator is the statistics of students and the statistics of higher education staff conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. Both are complete surveys based on the administrative data of the institutions of higher education. The indicator includes the students in the winter semester of each year. However, the researchers are covered on the reference date of 1st of December. Researchers in this context are defined as academic personnel at German institutions of higher education in primary and secondary employment (excluding student assistants). Doctoral candidates who are enrolled as students at an institution of higher education and who are also working as member of the academic personnel may be counted twice by the indicator.<br><br>The total number of all students and researchers from developing and emerging countries at German institutions of higher education was 247,433 in 2017. With 92.9&nbsp;%, students by far accounted for the largest share of the indicator value.<br><br>In the winter semester of 2017/18, 229,881 students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled in German institutions of higher education. This corresponds to 8.1&nbsp;% of all enrollees. The number of students from developing and emerging countries has increased steadily since 2005 (126,672 students) â€“ the only decline recorded was during the year of 2007. The increase in the winter semester of 2017/18 was around 7.0&nbsp;% compared to the previous year (214,813 students in the winter semester of 2016/17). In the winter semester of 2017/18, a total of 10,574 students came from LDCs, 4.5&nbsp;% more than in the previous year.<br><br>Of the 229,881 students from developing and emerging countries who were enrolled at German institutions of higher education in the winter semester of 2017/18, 39,338 came from Turkey, 39,541 from China and 17,570 of the students came from India. In total, 43.2&nbsp;% of these were female students. Whereas the European developing and emerging countries sent roughly equal numbers of women and men to study in Germany (53.5&nbsp;%), a third of the students from Oceania were women (33.3&nbsp;%). The proportion of women among students from LDCs was one quarter (25.5&nbsp;%).<br><br>In 2017, 17,552 researchers from developing and emerging countries were part of the academic personnel at German institutions of higher education. They accounted for 4.4&nbsp;% of all academic staff at German institutions of higher education. Compared to the previous year, their numbers increased by 10.6&nbsp;%, and more than doubled since 2005. A total of 649 researchers came from LDCs in 2017 (0.2&nbsp;% of all academic personnel). This compares with a figure of 558 researchers in the previous year. This was an increase of 16.3&nbsp;%.<br><br>Overall, the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries has been continuously increasing since 2007. If this development continues as it has to date, the target for 2020 could be achieved.
