It represents the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product (<abbr title="Gross domestic product" tabindex="0">GDP</abbr>).<br><br>Gross fixed capital formation comprises the value of assets acquired or constructed by domestic economic units for use in the production process for more than one year. It consists of equipment (machinery and equipment, including military weapons systems), buildings (residential and non-residential), and other assets (largely consisting of research and development, software, and databases). Impairment of equipment and assets is not taken into account.<br><br>The investment ratio is calculated by the Federal Statistical Office within the framework of national accounts (SNA) according to internationally harmonized standards&nbsp;–&nbsp;in particular on the basis of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (<abbr title="European System of National and Regional Accounts" tabindex="0">ESA</abbr>).<br><br>At the beginning of the 1990s, the investment ratio was just under 25%, but within about ten years it fell to its current low of 18.8&nbsp;%. Since 2009, the investment ratio has grown moderately and relatively steadily until 2022. Between 2022&nbsp;and 2024, the ratio declined comparatively significantly and, according to preliminary data, was most recently at 20.9&nbsp;%. Gross fixed capital formation totaled 898&nbsp;billion euros in 2024, of which 126&nbsp;billion euros was attributable to the government sector and 772&nbsp;billion euros to the non-government sector.<br><br>While construction investments have consistently accounted for around 50&nbsp;% of investments since 1991, the shares of equipment and other investments have changed significantly: While 40&nbsp;% of investments were made in capital goods in 1991, this share fell to 29&nbsp;% by 2024. During the same period, the share of investments in research and development as well as in software and databases rose from 11&nbsp;% to 19&nbsp;%.<br><br>In addition to the breakdown by product groups, gross fixed capital formation can also be broken down by the economic sectors in which the investments were made. The smallest share in 2023&nbsp;was recorded in agriculture, forestry, and fishing, at 1.4&nbsp;%. Manufacturing accounted for approximately 22&nbsp;% of investments (1991: over 28&nbsp;%). The remaining 76% was invested in the services sector (1991: 70&nbsp;%). Within the services sector, real estate and housing was the most strongly represented, accounting for 33&nbsp;% of the total.<br><br>Despite rising nominal investment, Germany remains weak in terms of investment by international standards. Since 1996, the investment rate has consistently been below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" tabindex="0">OECD</abbr>), which was 22.4&nbsp;% in 2023.</p>'

target_description: The target allows for various interpretations. For the assessment of the indicator carried out here, it is assumed that the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product should increase.<br>Based on the formulation of the target, it is not relevant for the assessment of the indicator whether the increase is achieved by an increase in the numerator or a reduction in the denominator.
