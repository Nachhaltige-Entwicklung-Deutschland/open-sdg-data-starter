dns_indicator_definition:         

dns_indicator_definition_new: The indicator shows the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries per year or semester. The number of students and researchers from the Least Developed Countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>) is shown separately.        

dns_indicator_intention:         

dns_political_intention: Knowledge is a key driver of sustainable development not only at a national level, but also on a global scale. Strengthening the international exchange of knowledge through Germany is an important measure in this regard.        

political_target: Increase the number by 10&nbsp;per cent from 2015&nbsp;to 2020, then stabilisation        

type_target: Consistent target every year        

data_state: 13.09.2024        

indicator_name: Number of students and researchers from developing countries and least developed countries        
section: Knowledge transfer, especially in technical areas        
postulate: Sharing knowledge on an international scale

content_and_progress: '<p><b style= "color: #19486a; font-size: large">17.2&nbsp;Number of students and researchers from developing countries and least developed countries</b><br><br>The data basis for this indicator are the statistics on students and staff at higher education institutions of the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Both are based on full surveys derived from the administrative data of higher education institutions. The indicator includes students enrolled in the respective winter term. Data on researchers is collected as of the reference date 1&nbsp;December. The number of reasearchers includes academic and creative arts staff at German higher education institutions; student assistants are not included. Doctoral students who are simultaneously employed at higher education institutions may lead to double counting in the indicator.<br><br>In 2023, the total number of students and academic staff from developing and emerging countries at German higher education institutions was approximately 349,000. Students accounted for the vast majority of this figure, representing 91.3% of the total.<br><br>In the winter semester 2023/24, 318,663&nbsp;students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled at German higher education institutions. This corresponds to a share of 11.1% of all enrolled students. The majority of students from these countries came from India (49,483), China (42,190), and Turkey (35,559).<br><br>Since the winter semester 2005/06&nbsp;(134,462&nbsp;students), the number of students from developing and emerging countries has risen continuously, with the only exception being a decline in the winter semester 2007/08. Compared to the previous year (approximately 307,000&nbsp;students in the winter semester 2022/23), the number increased by 3.8% in the winter semester 2023/24. Among these students were 19,505&nbsp;from the Least Developed Countries (<abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>), which represents an increase of 6.5% compared to the previous winter semester.<br><br>Overall, the proportion of women among students from developing and emerging countries at German higher education institutions was 42.0%. When considering only students from <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>, the share is significantly lower at 31.2%.<br><br>The gender ratio among students from European (54.3% female) and American (50.6% female) developing and emerging countries is relatively balanced. In contrast, only 34.5% of students from African developing and emerging countries were women.<br><br>In 2023, around 30,000&nbsp;researchers from developing and emerging countries were employed at German higher education institutions. This corresponds to a share of 7.1% of all academic and creative arts staff, which is considerably lower than the corresponding share among students. Compared to the previous year, the number increased by 7.8%, and it has quadrupled since 2005. In 2023, a total of 1,190&nbsp;researchers came from <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr>&nbsp;–&nbsp;representing 0.3% of the entire academic and creative arts staff (previous year: 1,070).<br><br>It should be noted that all figures and year-on-year comparisons may also be affected by changes in the classification of countries within the groups of <abbr title="Least developed countries" tabindex="0">LDCs</abbr> or developing and emerging countries.<br><br>The politically established goal of increasing the number of students and researchers from developing and emerging countries by 10% compared to 2015&nbsp;(215,000) was already achieved in 2017. Since then, the targeted stabilisation of these numbers has also been maintained.</p>'

target_description: The number of students and researchers from developing countries and least developed countries should be at least 237,000&nbsp;every year.<br><br>Based on the target formulation, the increase in the number by 10&nbsp;per cent of the 2015&nbsp;figure corresponds to a total number of 237,000&nbsp;students and researchers, which must be maintained every year since 2020. The politically defined target value was achieved in 2023&nbsp;and the average development over the last six years points in the right direction, meaning that indicator 17.2&nbsp;for 2023&nbsp;is rated as "Sun".
